## Disciplines, Interdisciplinarity, and Adjacency

It is difficult to address the question of methods without also touching on the issue of disciplines and disciplinarity, and in the context of this particular work, of interdisciplinarity. My artwork and research practice here is engaged in, amongst, or alongside three ostensibly distinct disciplines: video art, music, and design (FOOTNOTE: I use the term "design" here expansively to include technical activities such as software architecture and programming. This is in part due to disciplinary affiliations (or lack thereof), in that I do not identify with the fields of computer science or engineering, but more importantly motivated by a long-standing desire to place the emphasis of my technological work on creative and social concerns, not on computation as such). Within these disciplines, my activities can be further segmented into the categories of digital cinema, computer music, and inclusive software architecture. Yet such categories sit slightly uncomfortably, and the question that invariably arises from a confession of multiple disciplinary affinities is: What, then, is the relationship between these disciplines in my artistic and scholar practice?

First, I want to be clear that I am concerned here with affording a certain degree of autonomy--a slight gap--between my design, music, and video practices. This, is not, of course, to argue that there are no significant connections between these activities, but rather to retain, as best as possible, the unique medial and conceptual qualities that inhere in each, while opening up the possibility for something new to emerge from their proximity. Music, for example, has a somewhat "spectral" presence within this particular project, since the end product consists simply of a collection of videos, many of which are completely silent. Throughout the process of making silent videos, however, I was consistently composing electronic music, improvising on the guitar, and designing and supporting open source music synthesis software. So if my musical activities are to be felt within these videos--or, for that matter, my technical/design activities within either sides of my artistic practice--then I would like it not to be understood within a mode of "integrated practice," nor one that aims for a synthesis of media, disciplines, and methods, but rather one in which a small network or assemblage of parallel irritations and transformations are able to periodically move in and out of phase with one another. Indeed, it is this idea of systemic closure and transformation, rather than synthesis, that serves as the "metamethod" upon which my practice/research methods of lensing, open source community collaboration, and iterative, reflexive studio practice are based.

### Modes of Interdisciplinarity

Disciplines carry with them a specific methodological culture, a set of practices that serve to define and protect the boundaries of the field as an object and system of practice. The problem with disciplines, for me, is partially one of positionality. I have never felt entirely at home in any of them. Though it is tempting (and not inaccurate) to refer myself as an "interdisciplinary artist," or to argue that I am drawing together a collection research methods from each of the aforementioned disciplines in a manner consistent with "an interdisciplinary practice," several concerns emerge for me with such a construction. Despite its casual and prolific use throughout arts and design scholarship, the scope and definition of interdisciplinarity as a concrete set of methods or practices is impossibly vague. More importantly, the concept carries with it strong connotations that, for me, risk masking the particularities of my thinking and creative practices in each discipline.

In _Interdisciplinarity: Reconfigurations of the social and natural sciences_, Andrew Barry and Georgina Born have attempted, if not to specifically define interdisciplinarity, to at least identify several of its streams or _modes_, each of which suggest a set of methodological risks and potentials that I have attempted to either avoid, elaborate, or refigure in some way. First, Barry and Born identify the most common (or rather, the most discursively common and institutionally-sanctioned) mode of interdisciplinarity as "an integrative or synthesis model... in which a given interdisciplinary practice proceeds through integration of two or more 'antecedent' disciplines in relatively symmetric form" (10). Secondly, Barry and Born identify a "subordination-service mode," in which there is a hierarchical arrangement of labour where "one or more disciplines occupy a subordinate or service role to other component disciplines" (11). Lastly, an "agonistic-antagonistic mode" where interdisciplinarity operates as a "self-conscious dialogue with, criticism of, or opposition to the limits of established disciplines, or the status of academic research or instrumental knowledge production in general" (12). I will address these modes, and their relation to my own work, in order.

#### Synthesis and Systems

I am most worried, within the scope of this project, with the first mode of interdisciplinarity, synthesis. To synthesize, one must start from a set of distinct and recognizable disciplines, taking it as a given that they are compatible to be somehow merged or unified. Synthesis serves neither to bring into play new disciplines (by nature of its inter-ness), nor to substantially perturb the systems of existing ones. It is, then, always constituted by some form of _mixing_ of otherwise already established fields; an attempt at resolution, the building of bridges or, worse yet, the establishment of overarching conceptual frameworks meant to unify the otherwise disparate (Klein 27-8). The real problem with disciplinary synthesis, for me, is that it risks homogenization or generalization, erasing the particularities of a practice and suggesting certain aesthetic constructs that I specifically want to avoid. In particular, easy hybrids such as "visual music" fail to skip their familiar ontological grooves, to generate something new that is potentially more or other than "visual" or "music." These synthetic modes also assume, conceptually, a translational and informational model of practice, where information from one discipline or practice (music into video, for example) can be transported across disciplinary boundaries as "packets of meaning" and remain fully intact. In second-order systems theory, a theme I will return to later, systems are understood as "operationally closed to information from their environment." Applying this to interdisciplinarity, where the environment of a particular disciplinary system (e.g. video art) is formed by the other disciplines to which it is adjacent and connected (e.g. music and software design). As a result, "the environment can perturb living, psychic, and social systems but cannot _operationally in-form_ them" (Clarke and Hansen 9).

This model of disciplines as systems that interact in complex but operationally closed ways highlights what I see as the potentiality of practicing in multiple disciplines simultaneously: that asymmetric or apparently disparate activities can generate new insights in strangely context-specific forms. It is precisely the fact that methodological messages are skewed and transformed across systemic boundaries that can produce the possibility of unanticipated, non-schematic interactions and non-linear influences arising from the "gap" between disciplines or practices and their failure to directly communicate. Put simply, work in one discipline somehow ends up bending or altering another project asynchronously. Insofar as "cybernetic methodologies draw out the virtuality correlated with actuality" (Clarke and Hansen 3), my proposed methodological approach here perhaps also echoes the transversality of Felix Guattari, in that it shifts the methodological emphasis from "neatly tying everything up in a unidimensional manner... [or] of simply discerning patterns" and instead towards establishing new assemblages made consistent by "virtual lines of bifurcation and differentiation" and "ontological heterogeneity" (Genosko 36-7).

#### Subjugation and the Drift

Barry and Born's second mode, _subjugation/service_, is, I suspect, a more practical approach to combining disciplines amongst specialist researchers who are firmly affliated with a specific disciplinary centre, who "feel they hold the master discourse" and who "go on looting expeditions to grab some subject matter or methodology from some outlying discipline and drag it back to mine or exploit or reprocess it" (Simon Penny quoted in Barry and Born 12-13). This kind of interdisciplinarity was, for Felix Guattari, a form intellectual tourism; a safe place to visit for those who already have a strong methodological home. Disciplines in the subjective model are "indelibly stamped with the paradox of the between: subject to an institutional orthodoxization and normopathy that allows them to be valorized from an already established disciplinary perspective as exciting 'places' to visit and extend one's normal, core work" (Genosko 2).

I mentioned earlier that I felt I lacked a disciplinary centre, a home. Instead, what about a kind of vagrancy? A wandering through and between the scopes of disciplines, positioning them neither antagonistically nor in unison, but simply alongside one another in their singularity (Cecchetto 1). Or treating them refractively, as lenses, by looking through one onto the transformed field of the other. Seeing, for example, cinema through the kaleidoscope of sonic discourse. Or treating them spatially but not topographically, "rat-drifting" through the margins and back alleys of one discipline, forming creative by-products from a preoccupation with the activities of another (Arnold). My intention is not to unify or to bridge these disciplines in my life--computation, music, and cinema--but to place them adjacent to one another and to negotiate and produce their intersections, dead-ends, and distances as such. This is akin, perhaps, to McKenzie Wark's method of antipodality, "which begins from the experience of being neither here nor there. It's about drifting along a moving and variable line, and of thinking and writing from within that experience" (10).

Both Wark's antipodality and Martin Arnold's rat-drifting draw from the Situationists and their method of _the dérive_, "a technique of rapid passage through varied ambiances... [involving] playful-constructive behavior and awareness of psychogeographical effects" (Debord). I suggest, then, that like cities, disciplines "have psychogeographical contours, with constant currents, fixed points and vortexes that strongly discourage entry into or exit from certain zones" and which must be explored and experienced with both "this letting-go and its necessary contradiction... the dominance of psychogeographical variations by knowledge and calculation" (Debord).

As a method, what is key for me to the dérive is its _movement_, both with and against the gravity of a place and an activity. Rather than spatializing my practice and placing it at a fixed position amongst disciplines in a kind of methodological Venn diagram, I am aiming for a _theory in motion_ that allows assemblages of localized, tactical, context-specific affinities and oppositions to emerge between disciplinary practices. This metamethodology, disciplinary adjacency, serves as a decentring means to deflect the temptation to synthesize or subjugate my activities of one discipline to another.

#### Practice-Based Research and Adjacency

The subjugation mode is clearly at play in a somewhat different manner with the (academically) increasingly-necessary construction of "practice-based research," in which this project is inevitably participates, where ...

* one of the particular values of adjacency is in resolving the problem of "practice-based research," in that it allows art and research to remain distinct (as opposed to the inevitable subordination-service mode that it otherwise is cast epistemologically) and yet to form strange kinds of assemblages or lenses on each other

#### Agonism and Antagonism

Barry and Born's third mode, the one that they find most potent, carries with
it an appealing methodological politics that they argue can produce "more radical shifts in knowledge practices, shifts that are epistemic and/or ontological" (13). I have already argued for adjacency and drift as person metamethodologies that specifically loosen ontological cordons...

For me, working in one discipline can often produce strange resonances and modulations, some of which amplify and others which attenuate work in the other disciplines. In particular, my software development practice simultaneously has the ability to generate new kinds of creative or theoretical constructs, and, as often as not, the tendency disrupt and antagonize the work of making videos or new compositions. Developing, as I do, bespoke video compositing and sound synthesis tools from scratch provides me with the irreplaceable ability to focus on particular medial qualities--< example >--


The negative relation of technological and creative methods in my practice--the push and pull of software art (working for weeks without any kind of perceptible result) vs. the need to get away from the computer and out with camera, working in real time and ordinary life to produce simple videos with few edits or technical concerns...

## Methods in Practice

* Lensing as a theoretical/technical/creative hybrid method
* Open source and collaboration
* Is there also a method related to the iterative and interlocking unfolding of technical innovations and artistic potentials?



## In-Progress Area

Even in the more benign variation of a discipline acting in _service_ of another, there is a risk to my project. There is a rich history of techician/artist collaborations, notably in the 1960s, such asExperiments in Art and Technology (EAT), the collaborations between engineers and composers at Bell Labs, (Higgins and Kahn 10) and < the importance of my technical work as being influenced by aesthetic concerns, even while simultaneously maintaining a direct dimension of service to other artists and composers (via an open source community) >

* especially the particular problem of the "service mode" in regards to technical/artistic activities, where, as Barry and Born point out, a scientist or technology often adopts a service role for artists, or worse yet, the artistic qualities of a project being subordinated to the rhetoric of technical innovation that has become so prominent both in research and the design industry--I am vulnerable to both of these potential problems, as a technologist and artist


### Quotes


a call to "drop their relations... and all their usual motives for movement and action, and let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the encounters they find there. Chance is a less important factor in this activity than one might think: from a dérive point of view cities have psychogeographical contours, with constant currents, fixed points and vortexes that strongly discourage entry into or exit from certain zones."

From Keith: "A situationist-type derive (in an analogy I’m sure Wark would himself recognize), undertaken for its own revelatory pleasures, and which can in retrospect produce works which point to -  but are not themselves - the derive, which as experience is not identical to any of its representations."


Guattari: "transversality belongs to the processual subject's engendering of an existential territory and self-transportation beyond it. The key concepts involved are: mobility (traversing domains, levels, dimensions, the ability to carry and be carried beyond); creativity (productivity, adventurousness, aspiration, laying down lines of flight); self-engendering (autoproduction, self-positing subjectivity), territories from which one can really take off into new universes of reference" (Genosko 68).

### Old Notes


Introducing a music synthesizer instrument into the video compositing signal, for example, produces not just a form of "visual music," but a distinctly media-appropriate effect.
