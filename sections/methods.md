## Disciplines, Interdisciplinarity, and Adjacency

It is difficult to address the question of methods without also touching on the issue of disciplines and disciplinarity, and in the context of this particular work, of interdisciplinarity. My artwork and research practice here is engaged in, amongst, or alongside three ostensibly distinct disciplines: video art, music, and design. Within these disciplines, my activities can be further segmented into the categories of digital cinema, computer music, and inclusive software architecture. Yet such categories sit slightly uncomfortably, and the question that invariably arises from such a confession of multiple disciplinary affinities is: What, then, is the relationship between the disciplines in my artistic and scholar practice?

First, I want to be clear that I am concerned here with allowing there to be a certain degree of autonomy--a slight gap--between my design, music, and video practices. This, is not, of course, to argue that there are no significant connections between these activities, but rather to retain, as best as possible, the unique medial and conceptual qualities that inhere in each (for me, not universally). Music, for example, has a somewhat "spectral" presence within this particular project, since the end result consists simply of a collection of videos, many of which are completely silent. Throughout the process of making silent videos, however, I was consistently composing electronic music, improvising on the guitar, and designing and supporting open source music synthesis software. So if my musical activities are to be felt within these videos--or, for that matter, my technical/design activities within either sides of my artistic practice--then I would like it not to be understood within a mode of "integrated practice," nor one that aims for a synthesis of media, disciplines, and methods, but rather one in which a small network or assemblage of parallel irritations and transformations are able to periodically move in and out of phase with one another.

### Modes of Interdisciplinarity

Disciplines carry with them a specific methodological culture, a set of practices that serve to define and protect the boundaries of the field as an object and system of practice. The problem with disciplines, for me, is partially one of positionality. I have never felt entirely at home in any of them with regards to the identity politics of disciplinarity. Though it is tempting to refer myself, then, an "interdisciplinary artist," or to argue that I am drawing together a collection research methods from each of the aforementioned disciplines in a manner consistent with "an interdisciplinary practice," several concerns emerge for me with such a construction. Despite its casual and prolific use throughout arts and design scholarship, the scope and definition of interdisciplinarity as a concrete set of methods or practices is impossibly vague. More importantly, the concept carries with it strong connotations that, for me, risk masking the particularities of my creative practices in each discipline.

In _Interdisciplinarity: Reconfigurations of the social and natural sciences_, Andrew Barry and Georgina Born have attempted--if not to specifically define interdisciplinarity--to at least identify several of its streams or _modes_, each of which suggest a set of methodological risks and potentials that I have attempted to either avoid, elaborate, or refigure in some way. First, Barry and Born identify the most common (or rather, the most discursively common and institutionally-sanctioned) mode of interdisciplinarity as "an integrative or synthesis model... in which a given interdisciplinary practice proceeds through integration of two or more 'antecedent' disciplines in relatively symmetric form" (10). Secondly, Born and Barry identify a "subordination-service mode," in which there is a hierarchical arrangement of labour where "one or more disciplines occupy a subordinate or service role to other component disciplines" (11). Lastly, an "agonistic-antagonistic mode" where interdisciplinarity operates as a "self-conscious dialogue with, criticism of, or opposition to the limits of established disciplines, or the status of academic research or instrumental knowledge production in general" (12). I will address these modes, and their relation (or lack thereof) to my own work, in order.

I am most worried, within the scope of this project, with the first and second modes of interdisciplinarity, synthesis and subordination. To synthesize, we must start from a set of distinct and recognizable disciplines, taking it as a given that they are compatible in some way with one another--compatible to be somehow merged or unified. Synthesis serves neither to bring into play new disciplines (by nature of its inter-ness), nor to substantially perturb the systems of existing ones. It is, then, always constituted by some form of _mixing_ of otherwise already established fields; an attempt at resolution, the building of bridges or, worse yet, the establishment of overarching conceptual frameworks meant to unify the otherwise disparate (Klein 27-8). The real problem with disciplinary synthesis, for me, is that it risks a potential homogenization or generalization that erases the particularities of a practice, potentially also leading to aesthetic constructs that I specifically want to avoid. In particular, easy hybrids such as "visual music" fail to skip their familiar ontological boxes, to generate something new that is potentially more (or other) than "visual" or "music." These synthetic modes also assume, conceptually, a translational and informational model of practice, where information from one discipline or practice (music into video, say) can be transported across disciplinary boundaries as "packets of information" and remain fully intact. For me, the potential of practicing in multiple disciplines simultaneously is precisely the possibility of unanticipated, non-schematic interactions and non-linear influences (i.e. those that arise outside of the schema of methodological synthesis), where work in one discipline somehow bends or warps another project asynchronously.


This kind of interdisciplinarity represented, for Felix Guattari, a form intellectual tourism; a safe place to visit for those who already have a strong methodological home. Disciplines in the synthetic model are "indelibly stamped with the paradox of the between: subject to an institutional orthodoxization and normopathy that allows them to be valorized from an already established disciplinary perspective as exciting 'places' to visit and extend one's normal, core work... Interdisciplinarity in its limited sense... [is] an abracadabra word deployed cynically by many pretenders" (Genosko 2). Even in the more benign variation of a discipline acting in _service_ of another, there is a risk to my project. We have a history

The modality of antagonism captures a methodological politics that...

* the problem with hierarchy and antagonism (and the potential for the latter)
** especially the particular problem of the "service mode" in regards to technical/artistic activities, where, as Barry and Born point out, a scientist or technology often adopts a service role for artists, or worse yet, the artistic qualities of a project being subordinated to the rhetoric of technical innovation that has become so prominent both in research and the design industry--I am vulnerable to both of these potential problems, as a technologist and artist
* the problem of synthesis within my work and the alternatives to synthesis
** creation of new context-specific methods and "microdisciplines"
** Guattari's critique of "interdisciplinary tourism"
* the proposal of "disciplinary adjacency" connected to Wark's antipodality, Cecchetto's vagrancy, Debord's d√©rive, and ultimately Guattari's transversal creation of new assemblages
** one of the particular values of adjacency is in resolving the problem of "practice-based research," in that it allows art and research to remain distinct (as opposed to the inevitable subordination-service mode that it otherwise is cast epistemologically) and yet to form strange kinds of assemblages or lenses on each other


## Methods in Practice

* Lensing as a theoretical/technical/creative hybrid method
* Open source and collaboration
* Is there also a method related to the iterative and interlocking unfolding of technical innovations and artistic potentials?

### Quotes


Guattari: "transversality belongs to the processual subject's engendering of an existential territory and self-transportation beyond it. The key concepts involved are: mobility (traversing domains, levels, dimensions, the ability to carry and be carried beyond); creativity (productivity, adventurousness, aspiration, laying down lines of flight); self-engendering (autoproduction, self-positing subjectivity), territories from which one can really take off into new universes of reference" (Genosko 68).

### Old Notes

The challenge is in locating a practice at a fixed position in or across disciplines: I'm aiming for a practice of movement; assemblages of little, local "microdisciplines", with their own tactical methods, tailored to the work and its context.
