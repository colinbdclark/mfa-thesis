## Disciplines, Interdisciplinarity, and Adjacency

It is difficult to address the question of methods without also touching on the issue of disciplines and disciplinarity, and in the context of this particular work, of interdisciplinarity. Reflected here, my artwork and research practice is engaged in, amongst, or alongside three ostensibly distinct disciplines: video art, music, and design. My activity within these disciplines can undoubtedly be further segmented into the categories of digital cinema, computer music, and inclusive software architecture. Yet the question that will invariably arise from such a confession of multiple disciplinary affinities is: What, then, is the relationship between the disciplines in my artistic and scholar practice?

Disciplines carry with them a specific methodological culture, a set of practices that serve to define and protect the boundaries of the field as an object and system of practice. The problem with disciplines, for me, is partially one of positionality; I have never felt entirely at home in any of them. The identity politics of disciplinarity, a static representation of "what one does, who one is."

Though it is tempting to refer myself an "interdisciplinary artist," or to argue that I am drawing from a collection research methods from each of the aforementioned disciplines in a manner consistent with "an interdisciplinary practice," several concerns emerge for me with such a construction. Despite its casual and prolific use throughout arts and design scholarship, the scope and definition of interdisciplinarity as a concrete set of methods or practices is impossibly vague. More importantly, though, the concept carries with it strong connotations that, for me, risk masking the particularity of these practices. Barry and Born have identified three streams or _modes_ of interdisciplinarity, each of which suggest&em;for my project, anyway&em;a set of methodological risks to avoid.

First, they identify the most common mode (at least discusively) as "an integrative or synthesis model of interdisciplinarity, in which a given interdisciplinary practice proceeds through integration of two or more 'antecedent' disciplines in relatively symmetric form" (10). Secondly, Born and Barry identify a "subordination-service mode," in which there is hierarchical arrangement of labour where "one or more disciplines occupy a subordinate or service role to other component disciplines" (11). Lastly, an "agonistic-antagonistic mode" where interdisciplinarity is a "self-conscious dialogue with, criticism of or opposition to the limits of established disciplines, or the status of academic research or instrumental knowledge production in general" (12).

* tackle these definitions in reverse order
* the problem with hierarchy and antagonism (and the potential for the latter)
** especially the particular problem of the "service mode" in regards to technical/artistic activities, where, as Barry and Born point out, a scientist or technology often adopts a service role for artists, or worse yet, the artistic qualities of a project being subordinated to the rhetoric of technical innovation that has become so prominent both in research and the design industry--I am vulnerable to both of these potential problems, as a technologist and artist
* the problem of synthesis within my work and the alternatives to synthesis
** creation of new context-specific methods and "microdisciplines"
** Guattari's critique of "interdisciplinary tourism"
** and ultimately the proposal of "disciplinary adjacency" connected to Wark's antipodality, Cecchetto's vagrancy, Debord's dérive, and ultimately Guattari's transversal creation of new assemblages


## Methods in Practice

* Lensing as a theoretical/technical/creative hybrid method
* Open source and collaboration
* Is there also a method related to the iterative and interlocking unfolding of technical innovations and artistic potentials?


## In-Progress Area

Interdisciplinarity assumes, a priori, recognizable disciplines; it serves neither to bring into play new ones (by very nature of its inter-ness), nor to substantially perturb the systems of existing ones. It is, then, always constituted by some form of mixing of otherwise already established fields; a confrontation or an attempt at resolution, the building of bridges or, worse yet, the establishment of overarching conceptual frameworks meant to unify the otherwise disparate (Klein 27-8).

### Quotes

Genosko on Guattari's concern about interdisciplinarity as tourism: "Interdisciplinary activities were of little use to Guattari since they are indelibly stamped with the paradox of the between: subject to an institutional orthodoxization and normopathy that allows them to be valorized from an already established disciplinary perspective as exciting 'places'â€™' to visit and extend one's normal, core work. Guattari poked fun at interdisciplinarity in its limited sense and referred to it as an abracadabra word deployed cynically by many pretenders. But he made several significant attempts to theorize a metamethodology adequate to the passage from pluri- to transdisciplinarity" (2).

Guattari: "transversality belongs to the processual subject's engendering of an existential territory and self-transportation beyond it. The key concepts involved are: mobility (traversing domains, levels, dimensions, the ability to carry and be carried beyond); creativity (productivity, adventurousness, aspiration, laying down lines of flight); self-engendering (autoproduction, self-positing subjectivity), territories from which one can really take off into new universes of reference" (Genosko 68).

### Old Notes

The challenge is in locating a practice at a fixed position in or across disciplines: I'm aiming for a practice of movement; assemblages of little, local "microdisciplines", with their own tactical methods, tailored to the work and its context.
