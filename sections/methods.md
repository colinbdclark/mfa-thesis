# Methods

It is difficult to address the question of methods without also touching on the issue of disciplines and disciplinarity, and in the context of this particular work, of interdisciplinarity. Disciplines carry with them a specific methodological culture, a set of practices that serve to define and protect the boundaries of the field as an object and system of practice. The problem with disciplines, for me, is partially one of positionality; I have never felt entirely at home in any of them. The identity politics of disciplinarity, a static representation of "what one does, who one is." The challenge is in locating a practice at a fixed position in or across disciplines: I'm aiming for a practice of movement; assemblages of little, local "microdisciplines", with their own tactical methods, tailored to the work and its context.

 Interdisciplinarity assumes, a priori, recognizable disciplines; it serves neither to bring into play new ones (by very nature of its inter-ness), nor to substantially perturb the systems of existing ones. It is, then, always constituted by some form of mixing of otherwise already established fields; a confrontation or an attempt at resolution, the building of bridges or, worse yet, the establishment of overarching conceptual frameworks meant to unify the otherwise disparate (Klein 27-8).

Guattari: "transversality belongs to the processual subject's engendering of an existential territory and self-transportation beyond it. The key concepts involved are: mobility (traversing domains, levels, dimensions, the ability to carry and be carried beyond); creativity (productivity, adventurousness, aspiration, laying down lines of flight); self-engendering (autoproduction, self-positing subjectivity), territories from which one can really take off into new universes of reference" (Genosko 68).
