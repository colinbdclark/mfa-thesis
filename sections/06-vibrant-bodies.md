# Vibrant Digital Bodies: Cinema, Software, and Community

The goals of this section are to:
* Extend the concepts of materiality and embodiment to include digital cinema and computation
* Explore the relationship between community methods, my software artworks, and materiality
* Propose, based on Jane Bennett ("Texts are bodies that can light up, by rendering human perception more acute, those bodies whose favoured vehicle of affectivity is less wordy: plants, animals, blades of grass, household objects, trash") and Mark Hansen ("all reality is mixed reality", "technics are co-constitutive of our embodied perception"), that computation is itself embodied: software has a body, and enacts real bodily effects/affects in the world


## Community

The technical portion of this project involves two connected activities:

1. creating videos and music, such as _In Passing_, _Greenwich Park_, _Tofino_, and the soundtrack for _Font Màgica_, that are generated or processed by means of custom software I designed and built specifically for these pieces
2. designing, developing, and sharing with a community a set of creative tools and frameworks, specifically _Flocking_ and _Aconite_, that were designed initially for my own creative endeavours but also intended to be used by other artists in their own creative work

Every piece of "software art" in this project, along with the supporting technical frameworks and documentation, have been made using collaborative open source methods. Early ideas and concepts emerged via discussions with a distributed community of artists, designers, and programmers who have formed around the Fluid Infusion and Flocking communities<sup>1</sup>. Even this text itself, from my first tentative notes and initial annotated bibliography, was produced using open source strategies<sup>2</sup>. In the case of Flocking, a community of upwards of one hundred people, mostly artists, from around the world have used or contributed to it<sup>3</sup>.

### Open as Method

Open source methods first emerged within the culture of research software development in the 1970s at MIT, Berkeley, and elsewhere, and evolved into a more formalized body of practice in the late 1990s with communities such as those that develop the Linux operating system and the Firefox web browser (Voyce 416) (Bretthauer 16). In _Wide Open: Open Source Methods and Their Future_, Mulgan, Steinberg, and Salem define open source software as "any computer software distributed under a license which allows users to change or share the software's source code. Source code is the human-readable version of a computer program" (8). From my perspective, the most essential characteristic of openness as method is not so much the availability of source code (though this is a prerequisite for other forms of openness) as the way in which collaborative practices performed the context of an inclusive community have the potential to open up new creative "vectors for a collective becoming" that may not be possible with solitary, proprietary creative activity (Wark 159-60). I will discuss the importance of community and software as a vector rather than simply a set of practices below.

Mulgan, Steinberg, and Salem highlight that open source methods are "at the cusp of familiar tools," often resembling conversations, formal research teams, academic scholarship, and DIY communities (15-6). Amongst the characteristics of open source methodologies described in _Wide Open_, several are particularly germane to my practice: transparency, peer review and feedback loops, and incrementalism (16). These strategies have helped to provide a network of use and criticism for my work...

The term "open source" is highly contested, particularly by those who identify instead with the "free software" movement. This distinction is marked by differences of legal position and political philosophy (Stallman 32). I use the "open" here instead of "free" intentionally: in part to avoid what I see as the blunt ideological rhetoric and overt legalism of "copyleft" advocates such as the Free Software Foundation, but more importantly to suggest that "openness" (to creative expression and personal adaptation) should be increasingly conceived of as a characteristic of software artifacts themselves--not just to source code--and thus available _to all creators_, not only to computer programmers. Thus, I argue, "free software" is, as a political movement, largely a technocratic construction: creative control is centralized in software's programming language source code, where only a limited community--those who have access to the specialized knowledge of software programming--are able to benefit from free software's purported values of "liberty" and "freedom"<sup>4</sup>. Via my software development practice, manifest here in Flocking, Aconite, In Passing, Tofino, and _Font Màgica_, I aim to extend the values and methods of open source practice into the _material_ of my software.


### The Transformative/Material Commons

Stephen Voyce outlines an "open source poetics" based on "a decentralized and nonproprietary model of shared cultural codes, networks of dissemination, and collaborative authorship" (407). His model for open source creativity emphasizes appropriative, readymade, remix, and "uncreative" (referencing Kenneth Goldsmith) strategies, which call into question the role of singular authorship, shifting creative emphasis instead towards contributing to a "poetic commons" (408). In my soundtrack for Izabella Pruska-Oldenhof's _Font Màgica_, at her request, I used a recording of Chopin's Prelude No. 15 ("Raindrop") as a primary source, layering and blending it with recordings of radio astronomy events. These source materials, particularly the Chopin, were algorithmically transformed to draw out the shape and in-between moments of... The homemade Flocking signal processing algorithms... , producing an eerie and slightly melted expressivity

Voyce sees the generative potential in such citational-appropriative techniques, ...

I am interested in the way that software artifacts can be made to support "material linkages" between existing and new works in a manner that goes in some way beyond citation or appropriation. Voyce insightfully imagines that avant-garde poetics can protect and contribute to a "commons"

"The responsibility of the avant-garde will instead require an activistic obligation to create and fortify public domains of open source knowledge, to challenge excessive restrictions placed on language and information, to bring forth marginalized knowledges from a position of inaccessibility to the public at large, and to produce and share artistic tactics and works that challenge intellectual property. That which is at stake is nothing less than open accessibility to culture" (427-8).


### The Work as Vector

* Define what open source methods are
* Ask the question, why do open source, especially when many of the artifacts are personal?--it's unlikely that people will want to fork or remix or reuse this thesis
* Stephen Voyce suggests the potential of an open source poetics: "While modifying a source text might involve deleting or excising, it can also involve extending, transforming, and sharing a given work... Such techniques release a portion of a text from its static, fixed position in a single work, enabling it to participate in a proliferation of potential texts amid continuously changing assemblages of authorial, intertextual, and communal networks."
* And yet he largely links transformation to appropriative tactics or those that "break down conventions of authorship" [my quote] (which are great, but not always what I do) rather to what we call "artifactual linkage" where a work is a Warkian vector-- A vector is more or less a "technological medium"--in principle, anyway, with our approach a given application or, here, artwork, has the potential to serve in some way as the medium for some second-order creativity: an artwork that becomes the medium for other artworks, not as quotation but as "transformation"
* One of the key reasons for producing my artworks (as opposed to just tools that are directly intended to be used and reused) using open source collaborative methods is to turn them into _vectors_--more than just artworks but the basis for new abstractions and potentialities (this of course requires a very different approach not aesthetically, as one might imagine, but technically--to the tools that support software creativity)
* Acknowledge the aspirational character of this work--Alan Kay and the cardboard mockup


an approach to creating and distributing software and texts--including this document--in which artifacts are generated and refined in a transparent and community-oriented fashion and licensed in a manner that encourages reuse, modification, and extension.


## Notes

1. I am particularly indebted to the conversations I have had over the past several years via open source collaborative vectors with Dr. Antranig Basman, lead research architect at Raising the Floor International; Dana Ayotte, an artist and inclusive designer at the Inclusive Design Research Centre; Michelle D'Souza, senior inclusive developer at the IDRC; Dr. Clemens Nylandsted Klokmose at the University of Aarhuis; my primary advisor, Dr. Adam Tindale; and others.

2. The full history of changes to this thesis over time can be seen in its "version control repository" hosted on Github: https://github.com/colinbdclark/mfa-thesis/commits/methods.

3. This figure is based on interpolating between the number of "forks" of the Flocking repository on Github (thirty seven as of January 30, 2016), representing people who have in some way modified the source code (https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking/network/members), and "stargazers" (currently 297), consisting of people who have declared interested in the project (https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking/stargazers).

4. See (Stallman) for an overview of the libertarian politics of the free software movement, whose freedoms are always predicated upon the possession of the specialist skill of being able to write, review, modify, or verify software's _source code_. In contrast, I am interested in challenging (via practical efforts) the basic Cartesian dualism of computation: the distinction between "code" and its execution, where the nexus of change and influence is currently centralized in the source code, rather than the running artifact of software. I will pick this theme up again later in the section on _Software Bodies_.
