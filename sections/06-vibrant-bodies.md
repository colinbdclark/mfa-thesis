# Vibrant Digital Bodies: Cinema, Software, and Community

The goals of this section are to:
1. Extend the concepts of materiality and embodiment to include computation, electronic music, and digital cinema
2. Explore the relationship between community methods, my software artworks, and materiality
3. Propose, based on Jane Bennett ("Texts are bodies that can light up, by rendering human perception more acute, those bodies whose favoured vehicle of affectivity is less wordy: plants, animals, blades of grass, household objects, trash") and Mark Hansen ("all reality is mixed reality", "technics are co-constitutive of our embodied perception"), that computation is itself embodied: software has a body, and enacts real bodily effects/affects in the world

## The Materials of Community

This project involves two primary and interrelated software development activities:

1. Creating videos and music such as _In Passing_, _Tofino_, and the soundtrack for _Font Màgica_, which are generated or processed by means of software that I designed and built specifically for these pieces and their idiosyncrasies.
2. Designing, developing, and sharing with a community a set of creative tools and frameworks, _Flocking_ and _Aconite_, which were designed initially as a generalized support structure for my own creative endeavours, but grew to include use by, and support of, other artists in their own creative work

Every piece of "software art" in this project, along with the supporting technical frameworks and documentation, have been made using collaborative open community methods. Early ideas and concepts emerged via discussions with a distributed community of artists, designers, and programmers who have formed around the Fluid Infusion and Flocking communities<sup>1</sup>. In the case of Flocking, a community of perhaps one hundred people from around the world, mostly composers and sound artists, have used or contributed to it<sup>2</sup>. Even this text itself, from my first tentative notes and initial annotated bibliography through to the comments from reviewers of each section, was produced using open strategies<sup>3</sup>.

### Open as Method

Open software methods first emerged within the research software development culture of the 1970s at MIT, Berkeley, and elsewhere, and evolved into a more formalized body of practice in the late 1990s with the communities that formed to develop freely-distributed and openly-licensed software such as the Linux operating system and the Firefox web browser (Voyce 416) (Bretthauer 16). In _Wide Open: Open Source Methods and Their Future_, Mulgan, Steinberg, and Salem define open source software as "any computer software distributed under a license which allows users to change or share the software's source code. Source code is the human-readable version of a computer program" (8). It is worth noting that, even within this simple description, the predominant emphasis by open source software developers and academics alike is placed directly on the source code as an originary and authorial text. Source code is cast as the "human readable" manifestation of software, in contrast to its runtime form. This framing raises the question, of course, of how software is readable and writable, when, and by whom? These questions will be taken up below, following a brief discussion of open source methods within my practice.

Mulgan, Steinberg, and Salem note that open source methods are "at the cusp of familiar tools," often resembling conversations, formal research teams, academic scholarship, and DIY communities (15-6). Amongst the characteristics of open source methodologies described in _Wide Open_, several are particularly germane to my practice: transparency, peer review and feedback loops, and incrementalism (16). These strategies have helped to expand the networks of use and criticism for my work beyond my own local scholarly and creative communities. Work on _Flocking_, in particular, has been substantially supported by the very diverse perspectives that make up its community of users, contributors, and critics. By working transparently so that each change (known as a _commit_) to the system is visible to those following the project using the Github collaboration site<sup>4</sup>, Flocking's community is able to offer feedback, advice, and critical improvements while I work.

As an artist, however, working transparently and offering up a work-in-progress openly is a strange prospect, particularly when the project is still in the early stages of conception, before it has formed from a tangle of curious intensities into an object for use, discussion, or reception. Yet, as a result of my own openness and willingness to risk visibility in the tentative stages of creation, members of the community have been motivated to share their artistic projects reciprocally. I have benefitted from this mutual exchange significantly, not only gaining new design insights into how to support the needs and processes of artists who are significantly unlike me<sup>5</sup>, but also learning new creative strategies by studying, experiencing, and working through the software art created by others in the community. For example, the approach I used while working with the aforementioned recorded sound in _Font Màgica_ was substantially informed by my study of granular synthesis instruments created and shared by Alex Geddie, whose music for _Constructed Land_ subtly lenses recordings of "classical" repertoire into new works that occupy a strange, buzzing, stuttering middle ground between quotation and transformation<sup>6</sup>. In the past, as an instrumental music composer, I was rarely able to have such ready access to the scores and recordings of "non-master" composers except those within my immediate (though nonetheless highly germane) sphere of artistic friendships within Toronto. To be clear, this is not an argument for global networks and against local ones; rather, it is a acknowledgement of the new forms of locality that can emerge "telesthetically" around the creative currents and capabilities of shared artifacts and practices.

For me, then, the most essential characteristic of openness is not so much the availability of source code (although this is a prerequisite for other forms of openness), nor the enactment of a specific set of technical governance and legal practices, but the way that collaborative practices performed in the context of an inclusive community can engender artifacts that in some way materially embody these practices. Software that forms, to use McKenzie Wark's term, new creative "vectors for a collective becoming" (_Hacker Manifesto_ 159-60).

## Material Artifacts

As the term suggests, "open source" software development strategies, both socially and technically, emphasize source code as the locus of action and power within computation (Chun 21). Yet even the term "open source" is highly contested, particularly by those who identify instead with the "free software" movement. The distinction is marked by differences of legal position and political philosophy. "Free" requires, as an explicit feature of its license, that all modifications or derivations of the source code, including its combination with other works, must be distributed under the same terms as the original (Stallman 32). This is "viral" licensing, where legal requirements spread to everything a piece of software touches. Sharing is legally mandated, never a spontaneous gift. Free software advocates promote this as a legal right to freedom--"free as in speech," the ensconcement of a programmer's right to express themselves via source code, rather than the "free as in beer" of no-cost distribution (Stallman 43).

While I admire aspects of Stallman's project, I nonetheless have tried to intentionally avoid the use of the term "free" here in favour of "open." Partly, this is to avoid what I see as the increasingly blunt ideological rhetoric and overt legalism of many "copyleft" free software advocates who gravitate towards software's technical and logical construction (again, its source code), rather than its social and creative consequences: its _use in practice_. I prefer here to use the term "open community" instead of either "open source" or "free software." This term aims at the possibility that "openness"--to creative expression and personal adaptation of software--might be increasingly conceived of as a characteristic of software artifacts themselves and the communities that form around and within them, not just of source code. In other words, software has the potential, if approached differently, to form a kind of _material_ that can be worked on by means of itself, where the power to create and modify is available to all creators, not only computer programmers (Basman, _If What We Made Were Real_).

I argue, as a result of this failure to confront the material possibilities of software, that "free software" and "open source", as methods and as a political movements, remain largely technocratic constructions: creative control is centralized in software's programming language source code, where only a limited community--those who have access to the specialized knowledge of software programming--are able to benefit from its purported "liberty" and "freedom." Via my software development practice, manifest here in Flocking, Aconite, In Passing, Tofino, and _Font Màgica_, I aim to extend the values and methods of open community practice into the material of my software.

Wendy Chun: "Richard Stallman, in his critique of nonfree software, has argued that an executable program 'is a mysterious bunch of numbers. What it does is secret.' Against this magical execution, source code supposedly enables an understanding and a freedom--the ability to map and know the workings of the machine, but, again, only through a magical erasure of the gap between source and execution, an erasure of execution itself" (51).

This Cartesian dualism that Chun refers to, source/execution, haunts computation to its core. It is implicated in a related binary that Chun overlooks, the separation of _code_ from _data_. These dualisms crucially influence the way in which software's form and potential is commonly understood today, and account for how its materiality is often overlooked or fails to actualize at all. Conventional source code, before it can be used, must be transformed into something different: a binary executable created by a _compiler_. This transformation is unidirectional; as Chun suggests, it is an act of erasure that enacts the practical gap between source code, which is understood as fundamentally changeable and authorable--the "source" of creative power--and execution, which freezes the creative act and transforms it into an object and product. While code is apparently iterative and endlessly modifiable (by those with the skills and the access), executables are not; you can't unravel a piece of software and turn it into something else.

Software has few analogues to Amy Twigger Holroyd's _reknitting_, where existing knitted garments (most strikingly, even those that were mass-produced by machines) are modified or transformed in ways that were unanticipated by their original designers. Re-knitting, according to Twigger Holroyd, involves "a broad range of processes which can be carried out by individuals to alter existing items of knitwear. Re-knitting shifts a knitter's practice from the creation of new items to the re-making of existing pieces" ("About Re-Knitting"). These processes include unravelling, cutting, grafting, insertions, stitch hacks, and replacements (Twigger Holroyd, "The Spectrum" and "Treatments"). With these techniques, Twigger Holroyd and her friends make marvelously uncanny and expressive machine/hand hybrid garments by grafting new designs into old jumpers and socks.

_Figure x: Reknitted sweater by Amy Twigger Holroyd, which was created using a variety of slicing, unravelling, stitch-pickup and grafting processes in order to modify an existing, machine-made garment with her own hand-made modifications._ NOTE: NEED TO GET PERMISSION FOR THIS IMAGE!

As an art form, re-knitting shows how new works can be created from old ones not only at the level of reference or quotation, but at the material level. Using Wark's terminology, a reknitted garment represents not only the _content_ of the vector of knitting, but itself a new vector, or _form_, for the creation of another work from and within it. This newness is not just the result of a process of copying, quotation, or appropriation, but of the "virtuality" of the artifact itself--its ability to engender new forms. Yet it is also worth noting that re-knitting is not simply an idiosyncratic personal practice of Twigger Holroyd or her colleagues, but "an integral part of the practice of knitting," a characteristic of the medium and the traditional methods of knitting itself ("About Re-Knitting"). Even when mass- and machine-produced, knitted objects retain their modifiability and, as a result, have the ability to support a "community of practice" within themselves. As artifacts, they can be worked on by multiple creators and can support unanticipated uses and after-the-fact adaptation. It is this characteristic of modifiability--the ability to be serendipitously added to, subtracted from, grafted onto, or unravelled in a form not already planned for and designed into the object--that defines what I will refer to as _materiality_, the latent and unrealized potential of software. This materiality represents a form of _conviviality_, what Ivan Illich identifies as the "autonomous and creative intercourse among persons, and the intercourse of persons with their environment... individual freedom realized in personal interdependence" (_Tools of Conviviality_).

## The Material Commons

In contrast to this technologically-supported, integral concept of open materiality, Stephen Voyce imagines a more general mode of "open source poetics" defined by "a decentralized and nonproprietary model of shared cultural codes, networks of dissemination, and collaborative authorship" (407). His view of open communities and their relation to art practice focusses on appropriative, readymade, remix, and "uncreative" strategies, which call into question the role of singular authorship and shift creative emphasis instead towards how poetry contributes to a "poetic commons" of textual references and transformations (408). While, as discussed above, I think it is a mistake to focus only on the citational or appropriative modes of open communities, I nonetheless want to explore Voyce's idea of a commons in which works of art serve, via quotation and systematic transformation, as the "raw materials" for new works. Uniquely, Voyce argues that, underneath the agonistic and oppositional tropes, open community tactics have been an ongoing feature of avant-garde art movements (amongst, for example, the Dadaists, Fluxus, John Cage, and others), and that this tendency towards inter-authorial materiality represents art's ongoing role and responsibility "...to create and fortify public domains of open source knowledge, to challenge excessive restrictions placed on language and information, to bring forth marginalized knowledges from a position of inaccessibility to the public at large, and to produce and share artistic tactics and works that challenge intellectual property. That which is at stake is nothing less than open accessibility to culture" (427-8).

For my soundtrack to Izabella Pruska-Oldenhof's film _Font Màgica_, at her request, I used a recording of Chopin's Prelude No. 15 ("Raindrop") as source material, layering and blending it with the sound of radio astronomy events. Since Izabella had initially edited the film to the Chopin piece, I wanted to retain some of the affective logic of Rudolf Serkin's expressive performance on the piano in my own music. Using a network of amplitude trackers and granular signal processors, the piece's formal structure, its dynamic phrasing, was used as a signal with which to modulate and filter the playback of multiple layers of the Chopin along with the astronomical sounds. The Raindrop prelude's own compositional structure was fed back into the system, refracting itself into multiple layers of sound that are eerily offset from and mis-registered to the original, but which nonetheless carry their own strangely warped expressivity. Like Izabella's visuals, it is an overtly refractive piece, full of prismatic colours, distorted ghost images, and passing fragments of a receding original.

_Font Màgica_ gently sounds the technics (and phenomenology) of transformation. Neither a work _of_ traditionally-constructed originality nor one _about_ appropriation, it is a lensing apparatus, a technical-sonic system that is _complicit with_ Chopin and solar flares and the signal processing algorithms and Izabella's visuals. Though slightly different each time due to random signal changes--yet frozen in time as an optical film soundtrack--_Font Màgica_ is not an "open" work so much as an obsessed one. Chopin's _Raindrop_ appears everywhere, replicated at all levels as both a structuring force as well as a microsonic substrate. _Font Màgica_ aims for a form of systemic closure and inner self-similarity; a closure that paradoxically "realizes openness in its radical sense: not as openness toward the possibility of contingencies from the outside, but as a 'being opened' by the contingent materials that form the work" (Negarestani 3).

_Font Màgica_'s soundtrack, though perhaps obliquely, invokes for me the work of Chris Welsby, whose films form "cinema systems" that bind together the technology of the camera and the energies of the natural environment. In Welsby's films, the wind, waves, sun, rain, and clouds all are allowed to make a material imprint on the chemical, mechanical, optical, and durational surfaces of cinema. Nature and technology are not opposites, but form an elemental system. "Mind, technology and nature are not experienced as separate things divided along Cartesian lines but as interconnected parts of one larger, dynamic system" (Welsby, "Technology, Nature, and Software" 102).

In his 1974 film, _Colour Separation_, Welsby runs "film stock three times through a stationary camera; once for each of the light primaries. In the composite image, anything moving is represented in primary or secondary colour whilst anything still, having been filmed through all three filters, is represented in 'correct' colour" (Welsby, "Colour Separation Notes"). The effect is, of course, prismatic; the scene of a harbour with boats floating at their mooring is refracted and multiplied into layers by natural influences and the passing of time. Everything is gently in motion; boats and waves split and merge as colourful, offset ghosts while they bob about in the wind and tide over the course of the film. While _Colour Separation_ could be read as a meditation on the structuralist mechanics of film, allowing us to see the way in which a colour image is produced within the camera, it can be more subtly understood as offering up a quietly psychedelic view of time vibrantly transformed into hue. Welsby's network of emulsion, filters, camera, and weather gloriously intensifies our perception of time, folding it into the space of the camera frame and indexing its passing with colour. _Font Màgica_, I hope, analogously deploys its systemic transformations to bring out the in-between moments of Serkin's piano playing, multiplying it into layers of passing sound. Where Welsby's piece is "performed" by the wind and time's passing, _Font Màgica_ looks inward, peforming Chopin with Chopin, warping and modulating its own material components to produce...


## Medial Bodies

I want to take this concept of materiality as spontaneous or unplanned modification of or creation from an artifact--a form of virtuality in the sense of a potential to become something new, something other--and try to generalize it a bit, to squint at it and see what kinds of insights it provides to my cinema in general, not only those works that were created using my own software...

* the body of cinema--light, spatial coextensivity, duration--link this to the relational body of sound in Cecchetto
* Jane Bennet, poetry's body



THE KEY TO ALL OF THIS IS NOT SO MUCH THAT THE MATERIAL ASPECTS OF SOFTWARE ARE SOMEHOW THE SUBJECT OF MY VIDEOS, BUT RATHER THAT THE PERCEPTUAL EXPERIENCE, AND THE TECHNICS THAT CO-CONSTITUTE OUR PERCEPTION OF THE REAL, DOUBLES THE MODIFIABILITY OF SOFTWARE--THAT IT IS THESE TWO FORMS OF TRANSFORMATION--TECHNICAL AND PERCEPTUAL--THAT GIVE MY WORK ITS BODY, AND WHICH CREATES A COMMUNITY OUT OF AND WITHIN THESE ARTISTIC ARTIFACTS.



## Notes

1. I am particularly indebted to the conversations I have had over the past several years via open source collaborative vectors with Dr. Antranig Basman, lead research architect at Raising the Floor International; Dana Ayotte, an artist and inclusive designer at the Inclusive Design Research Centre; Michelle D'Souza, senior inclusive developer at the IDRC; Dr. Clemens Nylandsted Klokmose at the University of Aarhuis; my primary advisor, Dr. Adam Tindale; and others.

7. In open source software development, a "fork" is a split in the community that manifests itself in a systematized failure to share and contribute to a single artifact. As diverging features are introduced to one or the other source code forks, the result is often a break in the linkage between the two pieces of software, making them incompatible. In contrast, my goal (along with that of the Fluid community's) is preserve (via a new approach to programming) as best as possible the linkage of software artifacts even when faced of diverse and conflicting goals, requirements, and approaches.

## Boneyard

Following this, I will extend the concept of materiality into the created artifact itself, exploring (via the analogy of knitting) how software art can can be vectorized, potentially serving simultaneously as a "primary work" and as the medium for other, integrally linked works of art.

In contrast to Voyce's (and Stallman's, for that matter) textual, appropriative, "forking"<sup>7</sup> mode of modifiability, I am arguing for an artifactual one. Voyce: "While modifying a source text might involve deleting or excising, it can also involve extending, transforming, and sharing a given work... Such techniques release a portion of a text from its static, fixed position in a single work, enabling it to participate in a proliferation of potential texts amid continuously changing assemblages of authorial, intertextual, and communal networks" (409).

"The responsibility of the avant-garde will instead require an activistic obligation to create and fortify public domains of open source knowledge, to challenge excessive restrictions placed on language and information, to bring forth marginalized knowledges from a position of inaccessibility to the public at large, and to produce and share artistic tactics and works that challenge intellectual property. That which is at stake is nothing less than open accessibility to culture" (427-8).

The original material is often stretched out in time or captured in a single gesture--. It is a process of taking a piu

   * a process of de-registering and offsetting and making multiples, some stretched out in time or in a gesture, others just gently warped by an algorithm--and then re-registering the multiplicity of raindrop versions onto each other
   * and each version is somehow produced by a reading of the piece itself, through a different lens
   *--a little slower or faster, here, worrying over a region of expressive detail, there skipping...

   * but then the piece is open differently; each layer, each point of refraction is available to be separated out, reused, or modified in some way. Each node and edge in the assemblage has a name and a handle by which it can be manipulated and extended, "warbledRightPiano" and "distortedLeftPiano," every volume curve or synth that represents the macro structure equally with every grain of the stuttering piano is available to "touch"
   * the point of font magica isn't that I composed or programmed with extra-musical concerns in mind, but that it was supported by a _material substrate_ (flocking and infusion) and a set of open community methods that support its extension--that support its use as both "source" and "secondary" (and tertiary, and so on), as well as supporting its linkage between static and executable forms, its "potential" and "actual" forms
   * connection with Chris Welsby's _Colour Separation_
     * Even more weirdly, I’m linking it to Welsby’s film Colour Separation, which is completely different but there’s a kind of formal connection--these “mis-registered” layers of sound produced by adherence to a process or algorithm

I am interested in the way that software artifacts can be made to support "material linkages" between existing and new works in a manner that goes in some way beyond citation or appropriation. Voyce insightfully imagines that avant-garde poetics can protect and contribute to a "commons"

### The Work as Vector

The only characteristic that software today shares with knitting, I fear, is its ability to end up as a hopeless tangle on the floor. After the point of compilation into an executable, most software can no longer be serendipitously added to, subtracted from, grafted onto, or unravelled in a form not already planned and designed into it by its creators. And yet, unlike more distinctly solid artifacts such as wood or yarn or metal, software These characteristics, I argue, form the basis for software's largely unre

In the Latourian sense, a compiler fails to preserve modifiability as an "immutable mobile" within the system, and so < what does this mean, take it somewhere >... Notably, with the exception of specialized "automatic programming" (Chun's term) tools such as compilers, generators, interpreters, code's iterability--at least as it is commonly structured today within programming languages like C or Java or SuperCollider--is paradoxically inaccessible (or at least prohibitively complex) to other systems and programs. Software can't understand code, either.


* Ask the question, why do open source, especially when many of the artifacts are personal?--it's unlikely that people will want to fork or remix or reuse this thesis
* Stephen Voyce suggests the potential of an open source poetics: "While modifying a source text might involve deleting or excising, it can also involve extending, transforming, and sharing a given work... Such techniques release a portion of a text from its static, fixed position in a single work, enabling it to participate in a proliferation of potential texts amid continuously changing assemblages of authorial, intertextual, and communal networks."
* And yet he largely links transformation to appropriative tactics or those that "break down conventions of authorship" [my quote] (which are great, but not always what I do) rather to what we call "artifactual linkage" where a work is a Warkian vector-- A vector is more or less a "technological medium"--in principle, anyway, with our approach a given application or, here, artwork, has the potential to serve in some way as the medium for some second-order creativity: an artwork that becomes the medium for other artworks, not as quotation but as "transformation"
* One of the key reasons for producing my artworks (as opposed to just tools that are directly intended to be used and reused) using open source collaborative methods is to turn them into _vectors_--more than just artworks but the basis for new abstractions and potentialities (this of course requires a very different approach not aesthetically, as one might imagine, but technically--to the tools that support software creativity)


an approach to creating and distributing software and texts--including this document--in which artifacts are generated and refined in a transparent and community-oriented fashion and licensed in a manner that encourages reuse, modification, and extension.


* this idea of software as vector, as material, starts to eat away at the form/content dichotomy, since a piece of software, as art (content), is also a medium (form) for engendering new works.

Neither the term "open source" nor "free software" fits my project, though there are aspects of each that am I interested in.

The injection of "community" into my terminology emphasizes not just specific communities of design/development practice, but the argument that creative expression should be possible within context of the aforementioned "vectors of collective becoming," meaning that the act of _working_ a software material should offer the possibility of cohesion, not only of separation (which always remains a choice). Today's software rarely functions in this way, and software's "freedom" is always expressed in terms of its source code, never its "living form" at runtime; freedom here takes the form of a "right" that only an elite access.


The value of working transparently and in a feedback loop with  linking it as much to other like-minded creators around the world as to, equally, exposing it to different approaches that cut
    * working transparently and openly is strange
    * my work takes on different qualities by being openly available--serving as example for other other artists, and subtly influencing the kinds of works that are made by others
    *

The expression of such a material creative influence, however, can undoubtedly not retain its singularity--the myth of _the_ source as a singular "text"...

Chun: ". If we consider source code as a fetish, the fact that source code has hardly deprived programmers of their priestlike/wizard status makes complete sense. If anything, such a notion of programmers has been disseminated ever more and the history of computing--from direct manipulation to hypertext--has been littered by various 'liberations.'"
    * in response to Chun's apparently weariness (and wariness) about liberational projects in computing, I argue that we nonetheless need to pursue new and different approaches to computational liberation, since the litter she refers to is in fact cast atop an even more substantial landscape of consumption and control

Substantive changes made to software source code must always be negotiated through an essentially _centralized_ conception of community--all participants must agree to a kind of material "rule of law," or a "fork" will occur, splitting the common artifactual linkage between changes. (NEED A FOOTNOTE ABOUT OPEN SOURCE FORKING).

4. See (Stallman) for an overview of the libertarian politics of the free software movement, whose freedoms are always predicated upon the possession of the specialist skill of being able to write, review, modify, or verify software's _source code_. In contrast, I am interested in challenging (via practical efforts) the basic Cartesian dualism of computation: the distinction between "code" and its execution, where the nexus of change and influence is currently centralized in the source code, rather than the running artifact of software. I will pick this theme up again later in the section on _Software Bodies_.
