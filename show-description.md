Bio:

Colin Clark is a video artist, composer, and design researcher at OCAD University’s Inclusive Design Research Centre. Since 2011, he has produced a growing body of digital videos that explore the relationships between technology, nature, and time, often incorporating custom-made image and sound processing techniques. His music has been performed by Arraymusic, the neither/nor collective, the Draperies, and his own ensembles, Lions and Fleischmop (with Kelly Egan and Alex Geddie). Colin's soundtracks for experimental films by Izabella Pruska-Oldenhof and R. Bruce Elder have been shown at film festivals internationally. He joined Toronto's Loop Collective in 2001, with whom he has curated exhibitions featuring the work of Chris Welsby, Michael Snow, John Cage, and others. Colin is the creator of _Flocking_ and _Aconite_, web-based creative software for sound synthesis, music composition, data sonification, and video processing. These freely-available tools are used by software artists and musicians around the world.
