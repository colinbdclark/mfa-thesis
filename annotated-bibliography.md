## Agamben, Giorgio. _The Coming Community_. Trans. Michael Hardt. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993. Print.

In _The Coming Community_, Agamben describes a metaphysics that isn't defined by identity or representation, but of _whatever_ being, neither wholly class nor instance, but "things are just as they are, in this or that mode, consigned without remedy to their way of being... How you are, how the world is" (90).

For me, _The Coming Community_ provides a (perplexing) instance of theorizing the in-between, staking its claim neither in representation and abstraction nor in particularity, but in community. This was a key source for Wark's _Hacker Manifesto_ (below), and ties into Wark's political distinction between _representation_ and _expression_, which offers, for me, a way to think about the kinds of tools and apparatuses (artistic and technical) that we need. Specifically, those that provide individuals with a means to create new expressions, new forms, and to connect those expressions to a community that isn't based on a fixed ontology, agreement, language, or representation, but on lensing or transformation amongst diverse "beings-thus."

## Agamben, Giorgio. _What is an Apparatus?_. Trans. David Kishik and Stefan Pedatella. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2009.

Here, Amgaben reworks Foucault's concept of the _apparatus_, extending it to "literally anything that has in some way the capacity to capture, orient, determine, intercept, model, control, or secure the gestures, behaviors, opinions, or discourses of living beings" (25). He argues that an apparatus is the primary instrument of subjectification (of "humanization"), but that today's apparatuses, especially the spectacle and consumer technologies have disrupted this process of relationship-drawing between individual and environment, and serve now as de-subjectifiers. The key, in response, is to find means to "profane" apparatuses, to restore them to the commons, "to the use and property of human beings." Agamben doesn't propose specific tactics for profanation, nor models for media or technological apparatuses that can retain their subjectificative qualities, but of course one can speculate.

## Antin, David. "Video: The Distinctive Features of the Medium." _Video Art: An Anthology_. Eds. Ira Schneider and Beryl Korot. San Diego: Harcourt, 1976.

Antin argues for video's essential connection with the commerce of television. Duration in video works, then, always works in reference to the structures, rhythms, and timescales of advertisements and programs.

"But the time standard of television is based firmly on the social and economic nature of the industry itself, and has nothing whatever to do with the absolute technical and phenomenological possibilities of visual representation by cathode ray tube. For television, time has an absolute existence independent of any imagery that may or may not be transmitted over its well-defended airwaves and cables. It is television's only solid, tangible commodity that is precisely divisible into further and further subdivisible homogeneous units, the smallest quantum of which is measured by the smallest segment that could be purchased by a potential advertiser, which is itself defined by the minimum particle required to isolate a salable product from among a variable number of equivalent alternatives" (178).

## Bal, Mieke. _Travelling Concepts in the Humanities: A Rough Guide_. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2002. Print.

A key methodological text. Bal's method of _framing_ echoes my own idea of "lensing." In particular, Bal emphasizes framing as a active process that is bi-directional between framer and framed; framing produces "an event... is primarily an activity... performed by an agent who is responsible, accountable, for his or her acts. Furthermore... the agent of framing is framed in turn" (135). Framing is durational, ongoing: "where there is duration, change inevitably occurs: differences emerge over time" (136). Most importantly, framing, like lensing, participates in the constitution of the work as well as its perception and reception: "The frame is the link between work and world, not the cut between them" (141).

## Basman, Antranig. "If What We Made Were Real." Fluid Project Wiki. 2 May 2014. Web. 11 August 2014.

A polemic against the present methods of software construction, arguing that today we have only two-dimensional, artificial software constructions (as if they were movie sets); architectures that serve largely to consolidate power in the hands of software developers instead of user.

## Basman, Antranig, Colin Clark, and Clayton Lewis. "Harmonious Authorship from Different Representations." _Psychology of Programming Interest Group Annual Conference 2015_. Melanie Coles and Gail Ollis, eds. Web. http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2015-PPIG-26th-Basman.pdf

An in-depth description of the underlying software architecture that supports Flocking and Aconite.

## Bennett, Jane. "Systems and Things." Grusin, Richard, ed. _The Nonhuman Turn_. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2015. Print.

Bennett mediates between object-oriented ontology's emphasis on materialism and the essential "differential" or distance between objects, and Deleuze and Guattari's more systems-oriented concept of "assemblages" or networks of intensities, affects, and interactions. Bennett proposes a model where even otherwise apparently intangible, epheral assemblages such as poetry (or in my case, computer programs) can have a body and agency.

## Bennet, Jane. _Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things._

A model of human/object relations that emphasizes attempting to duck underneath human subjectivity (speculatively and imaginatively in an openly "naive" manner) in order to see the effects, energies, and bodies of objects.

Bennett's work provides significant support for my argument that media assemblages (i.e. my video art) and software have a materiality and embodiment that has real effects on each other and our own bodies.

## Brakhage, Stan. _Essential Brakhage: Selected Writings on Filmmaking_. New York: McPherson and Company, 2001.

An oblique description of the vitality of vision, of multiple modes and strategies of imaginative visual perception. A clear polemic against the regime of technique and self-erasure of hollywood filmmaking, and a lovely description of camera-shake as the beating heart of the "filmmaker as lover."

## Bryant, Levi R. _The Democracy of Objects._ Ann Arbor: Open Humanities Press, 2011.

Bryant provides an overview of second-order systems theory, arguing for its relationship to object-oriented ontology, Bergson, and Lacanian analysis. Bryant's version of systems theory provides a philosophical underpinning for my methodological arguments regarding the ultimate "withdrawal" (perturbation and irritation, rather than communication) amongst disciplines as systems. Further, second-order systems theory provides an alternative, less "informational" model (and arguably energetic) for technical and human systems and their interactions.

## Cecchetto, David. _Humanesis: Sound and Technological Posthumanism_. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2013. Print.

First, Cecchetto's theorizing about sound provides a model for understanding objects as have different kinds of materiality and relationality. I will use sound as a theoretical device when reading predominantly visual (my video art) and technological (software) works. Sound (as I will argue for software and digital video) is nonetheless material despite not being something that can be touched or placed precisely in space. "First, sound is differential... sound as such calls us to think of it as a particular object that has no substance, as a kind of ideal object that nonetheless has real material effects... sound resists being placed at all and is in this sense as much relational as it is differential... sound is emphatically not where it sounds like it is. Indeed, the added twist is that it also isn't where it appears to be... because it only comes to be at all through the differential act of hearing... Finally, sound is also multiplicitous... hear is literally to experience as constant something that is nothing but difference" (2-3).

Secondly, Cecchetto provides a challenge to the model of technological extension: "technologies today can no longer be adequately thought through the lens of 'extension' but must instead be understood as profoundly implicated in our being. That is, technologies are not tools that we use, nor objects in relation to which we are servomechanisms, but are rather pathways through a relational ontology (which may be another way of saying that technologies are also all those things that they are not)" (5)

Thirdly, Cecchetto provides an elaboration of and counterpoint to Hayles and Hansen and their (very different) theories of technological embodiment and discourse: "via an analysis of Hayles, the values that human embodiment expresses are enhanced in human-technology relations, where all aspects of embodied human reality are indissociable from questions of technology but are not overdetermined by them" and "Rather than attempting to access a prediscursive embodied Real, these pieces instead insist on the profound co-implication of discourse and embodiment by accepting it and even celebrating it. As a result, reversibility abounds so that we are continually reminded that language itself is captured within a paradoxical presence-absence that is, in a sense, embodiment. Thus it isn't that Hayles, for example, is wrong to insist on the impossibility of separating information from its embodiment but rather that this emphasis constructs--in the rhetoric of human values--the very separation that it opposes by acting as though disembodiment is a danger (and is thus possible). In constrast, this book insists that the question of embodiment is beyond the pale, not because it is outside of language (as Hansen argues), but rather because it is a paradoxical becoming of linguistic ambivalence" (164).

## Chambers, Jack "Perceptual Realism." _Films of Jack Chambers_. Kathryn Elder, ed. Toronto: Toronto International Film Festival, 2002. 33-44. Print.

Art as system. Chambers' model of _Perceptual Realism_ understands art as a perceptual system that modulates and transforms our vision; "a transmitter unit... It is an object to see with, rather than a thing just to see" (Chambers 41-2).

## Clark, C., Tindale, A. (2014). Flocking: A Framework for Declarative Music-Making on the Web. In Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference, International Computer Music Association (pp. 1550-1557).

A paper describing Flocking from the technical and software architectural perspective, offering readers of my thesis a place to go to understand the background and general concerns of Flocking and how it relates to other computer music systems.

## Debord, Guy. _The Theory of the Dérive._

A source of methodological drifting and creative displacement; "the dérive includes both this letting-go and its necessary contradiction: the domination of psychogeographical variations by the knowledge and calculation of their possibilities."

## Elder, R. Bruce. "The Cinema We Need" and "A Vindication." _Documents in Canadian
Film_. Ed. Douglas Fetherling. Peterborough: Broadview Press, 1988.

A polemic arguing for the complicity of narrative and technocracy, against representation, and for a "cinema of the moment," which struggles to reveal "how events come to be in experience, that is, the dynamic by which events are brought into presentness in experience" (264). A cinema "not just... in time, but one of time" (270).

## Flusser, Villem. _Towards a Philosophy of Photography_. Trans. Anthony Mathews. London: Reaktion Books, 2000.

## Fuller, Matthew. _Behind the Blip_. Brooklyn: Autonomedia, 2003. Print.

Echoing Cecchetto's concept of _humaneisis_, Fuller argues that the field of computation (especially Human-Computer Interaction) "has an unusually narrow understanding of its scope. Much of the rhetoric is about empowerment and the sovereignty of the user, whose 'personality' shapes and dialogues with the machine. It should be asked what model of a persona, what 'human' is engineered by" its discourse (12).

He argues for _social software_, which is "primarily it is software built by and for those of us locked out of the narrowly engineered subjectivity of mainstream software. It is software which asks itself what kinds of currents, what kinds of machine, numerical, social, and other dynamics, it feeds in and out of, and what others can be brought into being. The second strand is related to this. It is software that is directly born, changed, and developed as the result of an ongoing sociability between users and programers in which demands are made on the practices of coding that exceed their easy fit into standardized social relations" (24).

Fuller also identifies the power structures immanent in software's construction, "the inevitable disequilibrium of relations between the user and the programmer. This is a political fact which cannot be avoided. Despite the fact that free software makes public the labour which is repressed from visibility under proprietary software, it is still the case that whoever is 'closest to the machine' owns the space of possibilities which the relations have been established to explore" (26).

## Galloway, Alexander. _The Interface Effect_. Cambridge: Polity Press, 2012. Print.

Galloway's central argument is that computation is primarily _ideological_ (rather than ontological or metaphysical) in nature. I will perhaps argue that computation is indeed ideological, but its ideological positions are predominantly expressed via ontology and metaphysics.

Galloway also summarizes Lev Manovich's argument that cinema represents the first medium of computation.

## Genosko, Gary. _Felix Guattari: An Aberrant Introduction_. London: Continuum, 2002.

Genosko's overview of Felix Guattari's methodological heterogeneity, _transverality_, which for me serves and a critique and alternative (or at least ambivalence towards) to interdisciplinarity. "For Guattari and Vilar, 'the organization of human culture by disciplines belongs to the past, although to a certain degree it is a necessary point of departure in the advance towards domains of knowledge that involve new practices... disciplines remain closeted and largely ignorant of one another. While there has been much fanfare about interdisciplinarity, there has been little effort expended at the level of method to realize its implications... the task becomes, then, the elaboration of a genuine metamethodology that would upset existing power/knowledge formations" (38). Guattari's metamethodology encourages questioning, humilty, and openness of assemblages to dialogue and forms of exchange. Notably, he doesn't reject specialization outright, but instead suggests to "proceed irreversibly by fluctuation and bifurcation toward transdisciplinarity" (39).

## Hansen, Mark. _Bodies in Code_. New York: Routledge, 2006.

Hansen argues for the co-implication of humans with technology producing a reality that is always _mixed_. "Technicity, understood in its broadest sense as a relation to exteriority, as exteriorization, is not and cannot be something merely added on to some 'natural' core of embodied life. Rather, it must be understood to be a constitutive dimension of embodiment from the start" (ix-x). Echoing Stiegler, he sees technics as constituting humanity ("a stage in the ongoing technogenesis of the human" (21), and he positions this mixed reality within a kind of haptics: "Let us say that mixed reality appears from the moment that tools first delocalized and distributed human sensation, notably touch and vision... mixed reality, then, designates the general condition of phenomenalization ensuing from the 'originary' coupling of the human and the technical... a condition which can only be thought under the category of the transcendental because it can only be known through its effects" (9).

Hansen, via Massumi, casts the body as transformer of the virtual, "the analog creates reality out of the fusion or mixing of realms, out of transformation; not surprisingly, the body forms its primary agent: 'If sensation is the analog processing by body-matter of ongoing transformative forces, then foremost among them are forces of appearing as such: of coming into being, registering as becoming. The body, sensor of change, is a transducer of the virtual'" (6).

## Hiebert, Ted. "Delirious Screens: Flesh Shadows and Cool Technology." _CTheory_. Web. http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=592

A paradoxical and strange reflection on the transformational effects of the screen, drawing on Lacan and critiquing McLuhan's idea of technological extension in favour of "perceptual self-placement" within "the body/image of paradox of technology." Not unlike Bal's bidirectionality of framing, in the human/screen apparatus, "perception transforms its object, and in so doing, transforms itself."

## Idhe, Don. "Stretching the In-between: Embodiment and Beyond." Foundations of Science (2011) 16: 109-118.

A phenomenological account of technological extension into the realm of the otherwise-imperceptible via informational translation. I use this article a point of critique against informatics and in favour of energetic transformation in my own artwork.

## Illich, Ivan. _Tools for Conviviality_. New York: Harper and Row, 1973.

An approach to technology (i.e. to design) that explicitly takes into account the role of an individual and their community, advocating for intentional limiting of power within technologies to support communities.

## Kittler, Friedrich. "There is No Software." _CTheory_ (1995) a032. Arthur and Marilouise Kroker, eds. Web. http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=74

Kittler argues here that computation must be understood as essentially embodied, not "soft," but always as ultimately constituted by electrical impulses within the physical architecture of the machine. This physicality is obscured or sedimented by an "environment of everyday languages," without which we would be able to clearly see software's dependence on "transformation[s] of matter from entropy to information, from a million sleeping transistors into differences between electronic potentials."

While I don't disagree with Kittler, this appeal to computation's materialization as hardware obscures the material bodies that software also forms. While these may be invisible and somewhat intangible bodies (like sound itself), software nonetheless also possess a material that is of the order of the real, and which has very tangible effects on our everyday embodiment.

## Latour, Bruno. "How to Be Iconophilic in Art, Science, and Religion?" _Picturing Science Producing Art_. Carrie Jones and Peter Galison, eds. London: Routledge, 1998. 418-440. Print.

These two articles introduce Latour's idea of _immutable mobiles_, of the "alignments" and correspondences that remain consistent across the continuous series of transformations that is our experience of "the world." Here, the idea of information as a stable medium for representation is critiqued, replacing it with a model of transformation analogous both to the method of "lensing" that is crucial to my own argument about the function of artworks, as well as to the technologies that constitute my artwork.

## Lazzarato, Maurizio. "Machines to Crystallize Time." _Theory, Culture & Society_. 24.6 (2007): 93-122. Print.

Lazzarato reads Bergson (via Deleuze), and argues that video technologies themselves, as modulators, double the Bergsonian perceptual system and serve to "imitate perception, memory, and intellectual work" (110). In Lazzaratto's conception of video, it is not simply a medium for imprinting an image&em;a representation of reality&em;or of storage but, again, are energetic transformers: "The video camera modulates the flows of electomagnetic waves. Video images are contractions and dialations, 'vibrations and tremors' of light, rather than... reproductions of reality" (111).

## Lazzarato, Maurizio. "Video, Flows, and Real Time." _Art and the Moving Image: A Critical Reader_. Ed. Tanya Leighton. 283-291. London: Tate Publishing, 2008.

This is an earlier reading of Lazzarato's thoughts from the article above, but here he echoes Flusser's idea of photographs as a _significant surface_, but brings flow (motion) into play: "Video technology is a mechanical arrangement that establishes a relationship between a-significant flows (waves) and significant flows (the images). It is the first technical means of producing images that reflects the 'general decoding of the flows'" (283). It is a medium that is (quoting Angela Melitopoulos) "directly bound to light because video transforms and codes light through a technology" (284).

As in Munster (who cites Lazzarato extensively), we have signals, modulation and transformation (serving a dual theoretical/creative role in my own writing): "all images produced by electronic and digital technologies are transformations and combinations (composites) of intensities, forces, fields, taking place in the flow&em;the electromagnetic flow in the case of video... the algorithmic flow in the case of the computer" (8)

See Latour, "How to be Iconophilic" above.

## Mitchell, W.J.T. "There Are No Visual Media"

An argument for the strange interconnection amongst media (visual, sound, etc.) and the relationship to tactility, including a useful explanation of McLuhan's concept of _sense ratios_ and his own extension of it with _semiotic ratios_. "All the so-called visual media turn out, on closer inspection, to involve the other senses (especially touch and hearing). All media are, from the standpoint of sensory modality, 'mixed media'" (1).

## Munster, Anna. "Transmateriality: Towards an Energetics of Signal in Contemporary Mediatic Assemblages." _Cultural Studies Review_ 20.1 (2014). Web.

Munster describes video as an energetic system; using Deleuze's concept of _signaletic material_, she argues for technical media (in her case, videos created using drones) as "spatio-temporal relays between the human and the nonhuman technical objects" (2) and explores the operation of modulation and transformation of video's energies.

## Negarestani, Reza. "Contingency and Complicity." _The Medium of Contingency_ (2011): 11-16. Web.

A strange and wonderful argument for the radical closure of a work of art (in contrast to "openness to materials) in order to open it more fully to the weird and "twisted" (13) nature of material complicity: "Complicity exhibits this necessary shift from the inhibitive role of commonalities to the role of closure as a focused engagement with contingency, its intrusions, twists and suspensions. Whilst openness domesticates the thought of contingency through affordable states of interaction, commonalities and other forms of soft dogma, closure, on the other hand, turns itself into a 'good meal' or a 'genuine prey' for the real expression of contingency and its unrestricted play: the more closed a work, the more radically it is subjected to the interventions of its contingent materials, the wider it is broadened and butchered opened to the outside. Therefore, we can say that closure realises openness in its radical sense: not as openness toward the possibility of contingencies from the outside, but as a 'being opened' by the contingent materials that form the work" (13).

## Priest, eldritch. _Boring Formless Nonsense: Experimental Music and the Aesthetics of Failure_. New York: Bloomsbury, 2013. Print.

Eldritch's furiously ambivalent work on failure and boredom oscillates through a post-Baudrillardian cynicism to the kind of open-ended possibility of "listening away" within the ever-deferred state of waiting. On the one hand, he compelling argues that the '60s-era justification of "boring works" no longer operates, and instead has been fully colonized by a capitalistic and neo-liberal extension of the individual's responsibility to self-actualize and self-produce.

"...my intentions... are directed primarily at adjusting the terms and stakes of what I see as boredom's standardized justification in art and music as a way to delegate a work's meaning or value to the recipient--a gesture that is not without its merits--it is also a first attempt to baffle or outplay (dejouer) the discursive paradigm that frames so much criticism and analysis of avant-garde music." (21)

On the other hand, arguing that "ours is not merely a bored culture, but a culture in waiting" (44), he reclaims waiting (akin to Schweitzer) not as _waiting for_, but as "a non-discursive art of organizing human experience without a proper time or place outside of its own occurence. Waiting can happen anywhere, anywhen. How one waits is mandated by circumstances, but the capacity to wait is independent of any variation it may take. As such, 'to wait' characterizes a bizarre inactive activity that 'operates outside of the enlightened discourse which it lacks'" (67-8).

Ultimately, he brings the possibility of this localized listening back to our embodiment: "those who wait, become, in Lyotard's lovely words, 'good intensity-conducting bodies,' bodes whose alternating expressions of wonder and fatigue are testament to the radical ambi-valence of events" (73-4).

## Schweitzer, Howard. _On Waiting_. New York: Routledge, 2008. Print.

An exploration of waiting "as such"--as a undirected experience of duration and deferral, rather than simply a transit zone on the way to goals and accomplishments. Provides a Bergsonian interpretation of waiting and attention, and explores co-extensivity and openness in artwork.

## Sitney, P. Adams. "Ernie Gehr and the Axis." _Eyes Upside Down: Visionary Filmmakers and the Heritage of Emerson_. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008.

Sitney devotes a full chapter to Ernie Gehr, who I will write about in terms of his films' ability, (via duration and "structural" concerns) to modulate our during- and after-the-fact embodiment and perception. Gehr's _Side/Walk/Shuttle_ literally transforms gravity _in our real experience_ via its patient and poetic formal operations.

Sitney: "the film operates within a gravitational field in which traction, friction, and the position of the body play crucial roles in our sense of place" (232), where "groundlessness is as central to Gehr's cinematic oeuvre as the allegory of the displaced person is to Mekas’s or the loss of home to Brakhage in his Visions in Meditation series" (235).

## Stiegler, Bernard. _Technics and Time, 3; Cinematic Time and the Question of Malaise_. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2011. Print.

Stiegler argues for the essentially cinematic nature of consciousness, extending Husserl’s notion of primary and secondary retention with tertiary (i.e. technologically-mediated) memory. Of particular note to my work is Stiegler’s treatment of how the cinematic flow of time becomes interwoven with the viewer’s own consciousness perceptually and technologically. I intend to use this as part of an argument about how my work, and that of others, binds together memory, imagination, and cinematic perception with the everyday lived experience of the spectator. "'Recollection' is thus impossible... in all remembering of a past temporal object there is a necessary process of dérushage, of montage, a play of special effects, of slowing down, accelerating, etc." (27). Also provides some support for the idea of cinema (and other artwork) as an "energy machine" that modulates time and experience.

## Wark, McKenzie. _A Hacker Manifesto_. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2004. Print.

Put simply, Wark's manifesto provides a argument for the power of creativity to reconfigure the world.

Echoing Agamben in _The Coming Community_, Wark argues for the powers of creative expression over representation: "There is no representation that confers on the producing classes an identity. There is nothing around which its multiplicities can unite... it is the abstraction itself that must be transformed, not the representations that it foists..." (105) "To hack is to refuse representation, to make matters express themselves otherwise... To hack is to trouble the object or the subject, by transforming in some way the very process of production by which objects and subjects come into being and recognize each other by their representations" (109).

Wark's text provides a model for an alternative politics of software and artistic creation, one which is open and community-oriented in nature, and which I see as a current running through my own work.

## Wark, McKenzie. "Designs for a New World." _e-flux_ 58: (2014). Web. http://www.e-flux.com/journal/designs-for-a-new-world/

Wark positions art and design rooted in the same activity--the creation of new forms. From a methodological perspective, this supports my practice as both a designer (creator of software forms) and video artist/musician (creator of perceptual forms).

"Capitalism split production into two separate domains: the production of form and the production of content... Art is a subset of design. But it is a marginalized kind of design. The strategy then is firstly to assert the role of art as design, and secondly to overcome the separation of form and content in production."

Wark also, in this article, attacks the notion of "immaterial labour," which supports the idea that even ideas (and computer programs) have a body.

## Wing, Jeannette M. "Computational thinking." _Communications of the ACM_ 49.3 (2006): 33-35.

This article argues for the importance of teaching "computational thinking" skills to children in order to better prepare them for the increasingly critical role that computational systems play in our everyday lives. Wing, however, believes uncritically in the idea of computation as an abstractional logic, and as such argues for an essentially imperialist position for computation: "Computational thinking will have become ingrained in everyone’s lives when words like algorithm and precondition are part of everyone’s vocabulary; when nondeterminism and garbage collection take on the meanings used by computer scientists; and when trees are drawn upside down."

In contrast, my argument rejects this prevailing notion of computation's essential abstraction (drawing on, among other things, Alan Blackwell's "The Abstract is the Enemy" PPIG paper), positioning it (via creative practice) as a physical and material (i.e. concrete) force in the world, which acts on is and is acted on by our own bodies.
