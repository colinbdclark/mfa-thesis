## Agamben, Giorgio. _The Coming Community_. Trans. Michael Hardt. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993. Print.

In _The Coming Community_, Agamben describes a metaphysics that isn't defined by identity or representation, but of _whatever_ being, neither wholly class nor instance, but "things are just as they are, in this or that mode, consigned without remedy to their way of being... How you are, how the world is" (90).

For me, _The Coming Community_ provides a (perplexing) instance of theorizing the in-between, staking its claim neither in representation and abstraction nor in particularity, but in community. This was a key source for Wark's _Hacker Manifesto_ (below), and ties into Wark's political distinction between _representation_ and _expression_, which offers, for me, a way to think about the kinds of tools and apparatuses (artistic and technical) that we need. Specifically, those that provide individuals with a means to create new expressions, new forms, and to connect those expressions to a community that isn't based on a fixed ontology, agreement, language, or representation, but on lensing or transformation amongst diverse "beings-thus."

## Agamben, Giorgio. _What is an Apparatus?_. Trans. David Kishik and Stefan Pedatella. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2009.

Here, Amgaben reworks Foucault's concept of the _apparatus_, extending it to "literally anything that has in some way the capacity to capture, orient, determine, intercept, model, control, or secure the gestures, behaviors, opinions, or discourses of living beings" (25). He argues that an apparatus is the primary instrument of subjectification (of "humanization"), but that today's apparatuses, especially the spectacle and consumer technologies have disrupted this process of relationship-drawing between individual and environment, and serve now as de-subjectifiers. The key, in response, is to find means to "profane" apparatuses, to restore them to the commons, "to the use and property of human beings." Agamben doesn't propose specific tactics for profanation, nor models for media or technological apparatuses that can retain their subjectificative qualities, but of course one can speculate.

## Bal, Mieke. _Travelling Concepts in the Humanities: A Rough Guide_. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2002. Print.

A key methodological text. Bal's method of _framing_ echoes my own idea of "lensing." In particular, Bal emphasizes framing as a active process that is bi-directional between framer and framed; framing produces "an event... is primarily an activity... performed by an agent who is responsible, accountable, for his or her acts. Furthermore... the agent of framing is framed in turn" (135). Framing is durational, ongoing: "where there is duration, change inevitably occurs: differences emerge over time" (136). Most importantly, framing, like lensing, participates in the constitution of the work as well as its perception and reception: "The frame is the link between work and world, not the cut between them" (141).

## Basman, Antranig. "If What We Made Were Real." Fluid Project Wiki. 2 May 2014. Web. 11 August 2014.

A polemic against the present methods of software construction, arguing that today we have only two-dimensional, artificial software constructions (as if they were movie sets); architectures that serve largely to consolidate power in the hands of software developers instead of user.

An in-depth description of the underlying software architecture that supports Flocking and Aconite.

## Brakhage, Stan. _Essential Brakhage: Selected Writings on Filmmaking_. New York: McPherson and Company, 2001.

An oblique description of the vitality of vision, of multiple modes and strategies of imaginative visual perception. A clear polemic against the regime of technique and self-erasure of hollywood filmmaking, and a lovely description of camera-shake as the beating heart of the "filmmaker as lover."

## Bryant, Levi R. _The Democracy of Objects._ Ann Arbor: Open Humanities Press, 2011.

Bryant provides an overview of second-order systems theory, arguing for its relationship to object-oriented ontology, Bergson, and Lacanian analysis. Bryant's version of systems theory provides a philosophical underpinning for my methodological arguments regarding the ultimate "withdrawal" (perturbation and irritation, rather than communication) amongst disciplines as systems. Further, second-order systems theory provides an alternative, less "informational" model (and arguably energetic) for technical and human systems and their interactions.

## Chambers, Jack "Perceptual Realism." _Films of Jack Chambers_. Kathryn Elder, ed. Toronto: Toronto International Film Festival, 2002. 33-44. Print.

Art as system. Chambers' model of _Perceptual Realism_ understands art as a perceptual system that modulates and transforms our vision; "a transmitter unit... It is an object to see with, rather than a thing just to see" (Chambers 41-2).

## Clark, C., Tindale, A. (2014). Flocking: A Framework for Declarative Music-Making on the Web. In Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference, International Computer Music Association (pp. 1550-1557).

A paper describing Flocking from the technical and software architectural perspective, offering readers of my thesis a place to go to understand the background and general concerns of Flocking and how it relates to other computer music systems.

## Bennett, Jane. "Systems and Things." Grusin, Richard, ed. _The Nonhuman Turn_. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2015. Print.

Bennett mediates between object-oriented ontology's emphasis on materialism and the essential "differential" or distance between objects, and Deleuze and Guattari's more systems-oriented concept of "assemblages" or networks of intensities, affects, and interactions. Bennett proposes a model where even otherwise apparently intangible, empheral assemblages such as poetry (or in my case, computer programs) can have a body and agency.

## Hansen, Mark. _Bodies in Code_. New York: Routledge, 2006.

## Hess, Felix. _Light as Air_. Heidelberg: Velag Kehrer, 2001. Print.

Felix Hess is a sound and installation artist who uses simple technologies to create unstable, interacting "agents" that couple natural processes, technological networks, and human perceptual sensitivity to the environment. _Light as Air_ includes essay by Hess and others that emphasize the role of sensitivity and attention within his work, two themes that are crucial to my own artistic practice.

## Kittler, Friedrich. "There is No Software." _CTheory_ (1995) a032. Arthur and Marilouise Kroker, eds. Web. http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=74

Kittler argues here that computation must be understood as essentially embodied, not "soft," but always as ultimately constituted by electrical impulses within the physical architecture of the machine. This physicality is obscured or sedimented by an "environment of everyday languages," without which we would be able to clearly see software's dependence on "transformation[s] of matter from entropy to information, from a million sleeping transistors into differences between electronic potentials."

While I don't disagree with Kittler, this appeal to computation's materialization as hardware obscures the material bodies that software also forms. While these may be invisible and somewhat intangible bodies (like sound itself), software nonetheless also possess a material that is of the order of the real, and which has very tangible effects on our everyday embodiment.

## Lazzarato, Maurizio. "Machines to Crystallize Time." _Theory, Culture & Society_. 24.6 (2007): 93-122. Print.

Lazzarato reads Bergson (via Deleuze), and argues that video technologies themselves, as modulators, double the Bergsonian perceptual system and serve to "imitate perception, memory, and intellectual work" (110). In Lazzaratto's conception of video, it is not simply a medium for imprinting an image&em;a representation of reality&em;or of storage but, again, are energetic transformers: "The video camera modulates the flows of electomagnetic waves. Video images are contractions and dialations, 'vibrations and tremors' of light, rather than... reproductions of reality" (111).

## Lazzarato, Maurizio. "Video, Flows, and Real Time." _Art and the Moving Image: A Critical Reader_. Ed. Tanya Leighton. 283-291. London: Tate Publishing, 2008.

This is an earlier reading of Lazzarato's thoughts from the article above, but here he echoes Flusser's idea of photographs as a _significant surface_, but brings flow (motion) into play: "Video technology is a mechanical arrangement that establishes a relationship between a-significant flows (waves) and significant flows (the images). It is the first technical means of producing images that reflects the 'general decoding of the flows'" (283). It is a medium that is (quoting Angela Melitopoulos) "directly bound to light because video transforms and codes light through a technology" (284).

As in Munster (who cites Lazzarato extensively), we have signals, modulation and transformation (serving a dual theoretical/creative role in my own writing): "all images produced by electronic and digital technologies are transformations and combinations (composites) of intensities, forces, fields, taking place in the flow&em;the electromagnetic flow in the case of video... the algorithmic flow in the case of the computer" (8)

## Lovink, Geert and Pit Schultz. "There is no information, only transformation: An Interview with Bruno Latour." Web. http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime- l-9709/msg00006.html

These two articles introduce Latour's idea of _immutable mobiles_, of the "alignments" and correspondences that remain consistent across the continuous series of transformations that is our experience of "the world." Here, the idea of information as a stable medium for representation is critiqued, replacing it with a model of transformation analogous both to the method of "lensing" that is crucial to my own argument about the function of artworks, as well as to the technologies that constitute my artwork.

## Munster, Anna. "Transmateriality: Towards an Energetics of Signal in Contemporary Mediatic Assemblages." _Cultural Studies Review_ 20.1 (2014). Web.

Munster describes video as an energetic system; using Deleuze's concept of _signaletic material_, she argues for technical media (in her case, videos created using drones) as "spatio-temporal relays between the human and the nonhuman technical objects" (2) and explores the operation of modulation and transformation of video's energies.

## Priest, eldritch. _Boring Formless Nonsense: Experimental Music and the Aesthetics of Failure_. New York: Bloomsbury, 2013. Print.

## Schweitzer, Howard. _On Waiting_. New York: Routledge, 2008. Print.

An exploration of waiting "as such"--as a undirected experience of duration and deferral, rather than simply a transit zone on the way to goals and accomplishments. Provides a Bergsonian interpretation of waiting and attention, and explores co-extensivity and openness in artwork.

## Stiegler, Bernard. _Technics and Time, 3; Cinematic Time and the Question of Malaise_. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2011. Print.

Stiegler argues for the essentially cinematic nature of consciousness, extending Husserl’s notion of primary and secondary retention with tertiary (i.e. technologically-mediated) memory. Of particular note to my work is Stiegler’s treatment of how the cinematic flow of time becomes interwoven with the viewer’s own consciousness perceptually and technologically. I intend to use this as part of an argument about how my work, and that of others, binds together memory, imagination, and cinematic perception with the everyday lived experience of the spectator. "'Recollection' is thus impossible... in all remembering of a past temporal object there is a necessary process of dérushage, of montage, a play of special effects, of slowing down, accelerating, etc." (27). Also provides some support for the idea of cinema (and other artwork) as an "energy machine" that modulates time and experience.

## Wark, McKenzie. _A Hacker Manifesto_. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2004. Print.

## Wark, McKenzie. "Designs for a New World." _e-flux_ 58: (2014). Web. http://www.e-flux.com/journal/designs-for-a-new-world/

Wark positions art and design rooted in the same activity--the creation of new forms. From a methodological perspective, this supports my practice as both a designer (creator of software forms) and video artist/musician (creator of perceptual forms).

"Capitalism split production into two separate domains: the production of form and the production of content... Art is a subset of design. But it is a marginalized kind of design. The strategy then is firstly to assert the role of art as design, and secondly to overcome the separation of form and content in production."

Wark also, in this article, attacks the notion of "immaterial labour," which supports the idea that even ideas (and computer programs) have a body.


## Wing, Jeannette M. "Computational thinking." _Communications of the ACM_ 49.3 (2006): 33-35.

This article argues for the importance of teaching "computational thinking" skills to children in order to better prepare them for the increasingly critical role that computational systems play in our everyday lives. Wing, however, believes uncritically in the idea of computation as an abstractional logic, and as such argues for an essentially imperialist position for computation: "Computational thinking will have become ingrained in everyone’s lives when words like algorithm and precondition are part of everyone’s vocabulary; when nondeterminism and garbage collection take on the meanings used by computer scientists; and when trees are drawn upside down."

In contrast, my argument rejects this prevailing notion of computation's essential abstraction (drawing on, among other things, Alan Blackwell's "The Abstract is the Enemy" PPIG paper), positioning it (via creative practice) as a physical and material (i.e. concrete) force in the world, which acts on is and is acted on by our own bodies.
