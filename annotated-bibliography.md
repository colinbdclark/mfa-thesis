Felix Hess is a sound and installation artist who uses simple technologies to create unstable, interacting "agents" that couple natural processes, technological networks, and human perceptual sensitivity to the environment. _Light as Air_ includes essay by Hess and others that emphasize the role of sensitivity and attention within his work, two themes that are crucial to my own artistic practice.

## Lovink, Geert and Pit Schultz. "There is no information, only transformation: An Interview with Bruno Latour." Web. http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime- l-9709/msg00006.html

These two articles introduce Latour's idea of _immutable mobiles_, of the "alignments" and correspondences that remain consistent across the continuous series of transformations that is our experience of "the world." Here, the idea of information as a stable medium for representation is critiqued, replacing it with a model of transformation analogous both to the method of "lensing" that is crucial to my own argument about the function of artworks, as well as to the technologies that constitute my artwork.

## Schweitzer, Howard. _On Waiting_. New York: Routledge, 2008. Print.

An exploration of waiting "as such"--as a undirected experience of duration and deferral, rather than simply a transit zone on the way to goals and accomplishments. Provides a Bergsonian interpretation of waiting and attention, and explores co-extensivity and openness in artwork.

## Stiegler, Bernard. _Technics and Time, 3; Cinematic Time and the Question of Malaise_. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2011. Print.

Stiegler argues for the essentially cinematic nature of consciousness, extending Husserl’s notion of primary and secondary retention with tertiary (i.e. technologically-mediated) memory. Of particular note to my work is Stiegler’s treatment of how the cinematic flow of time becomes interwoven with the viewer’s own consciousness perceptually and technologically. I intend to use this as part of an argument about how my work, and that of others, binds together memory, imagination, and cinematic perception with the everyday lived experience of the spectator. "'Recollection' is thus impossible... in all remembering of a past temporal object there is a necessary process of dérushage, of montage, a play of special effects, of slowing down, accelerating, etc." (27). Also provides some support for the idea of cinema (and other artwork) as an "energy machine" that modulates time and experience.
