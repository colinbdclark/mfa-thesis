# Notes on Information, Bodies, and Energy

* the key is a different form of materiality, one which is not dominated by the "structuring metaphors" of solidity, permanence, etc. and towards more flexible materials, particularly (like Trigger-Holroyd) those that are amenable to extension, change over time
* artwork as vector: structuring of communities around _an artifact_

## Wark, Hacker Manifesto

Highlighted on Page 44: The hacking of new vectors of information has indeed been the turning point in the emergence of a broader awareness of the creative production of abstraction.

Page 45: "Everywhere the desire to open the virtuality of information, to share data as a gift, to appropriate the vector for expression"

"To the extent that nature exists even in its disappearance, it exists as expression. Nature still exists, not as the other of the social, but as the multiplicity of forces that the human in concert with the nonhuman articulate and express. In differentiating itself from nature, human agency does not alienate itself from nature, it merely brings into being yet one more aspect of nature’s multiplicity" (77).

"Once the vector reaches the point of the development of telesthesia--the perception at a distance of the telegraph, telephone, television--it effects a separation of the flow of communication from the flow of objects and subjects, and thus produces the appearance of information as a world apart" (79).

"Information--in the commodified form of communication--becomes the governing metaphor for the world precisely because it dominates it in actuality" (79)

"Third nature, in its very totality, its spectacle of vectors and vectors of spectacle, becomes an ecology of images which may yet become an image of a possible ecology. Third nature relentlessly enfolds the subject in images of the world as its object. But in its very ubiquity, it dissolves the particular relations of subjects to objects, and represents subjects as a whole with the image of an objective world as a whole. In its very falsity, it represents the relation between subject and object as a false relation, but nevertheless as a relation. Third nature reveals its own nature to be something produced. Third nature reveals itself as something not only produced, but productive. Information appears as expression, not just as representation, as something produced in its difference from the world" (80)

Highlighted on Page 88: What calls for a creative applicationof the hack is the production of new vectors along whichthe event may continue to unfold after its initial explosioninto social space, and avoid capture by representation.

"According to Bohr, theoretical concepts (e.g., "position" and "momentum") are not ideational in character but rather are specific physical arrangements" (814).

"Matter does not refer to a fixed substance; rather, matter is substance in its intra-active becoming--not a thing, but a doing, a congealing of agency. Matter is a stabilizing and destabilizing process of iterative intra-activity" (822).

"Bodies are not objects with inherent boundaries and properties; they are material-discursive phenomena. "Human" bodies are not inherently different from "nonhuman" ones. What constitutes the "human" (and the "nonhuman") is not a fixed or pregiven notion, but nor is it a free-floating ideality. What is at issue is not some ill-defined process by which human-based linguistic practices (materially supported in some unspecified way) manage to produce substantive bodies/bodily substances but rather a material dynamics of intra-activity: material apparatuses produce material phenomena through specific causal intra-actions, where "material" is always already material-discursive--that is what it means to matter. Theories that focus exclusively on the materialization of "human" bodies miss the crucial point that the very practices by which the differential boundaries of the "human" and the "nonhuman" are drawn are always already implicated in particular materializations. (823-4)

Highlighted on Page 10: Yet, if the centrality of immaterial labor in advanced economies relies increasingly on complex social networks made avail-able by digital technologies, then it is this same mode of production that threatens to demystify individual creativity and to expand nonproprietary forms of knowledge production. If such networks reveal anything about the laboring activities of scientists, technologists, protest movements, or, indeed, even poets, it is that creativity demands appropriation, collabora-tion, and community.

Highlighted on Page 20: To call a poetic text “commons based” signals its participation within a larger ensemble of discourses, events, and actions undertaken to protect public culture from proprietary enclosure.

Highlighted on Page 21: Next, we should conceive of the commons as a practice—and thus in-ject a logic of the commons into the fabric of our thoughts and actions.

Pages 22-3: This now canonical definition of modernist experimental practice overshadows the intensely social projects of com-munity building undertaken by artistic communities throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It is this social imperative that gives direction to contemporary practice. The role of artistic and literary collectives today need not jettison agonism as such, but rather its sometimes elitist, chauvinistic, fascistic, and eschatological associations. The respon-sibility of the avant-garde will instead require an activistic obligation to create and fortify public domains of open source knowledge, to challenge excessive restrictions placed on language and information, to bring forth marginalized knowledges from a position of inaccessibility to the public at large, and to produce and share artistic tactics and works that challenge intellectual property. That which is at stake is nothing less than open acces-sibility to culture. Hence, writers and artists are becoming more collaborative and interdisciplinary, drawing on the general and specialized skills of archivists, programmers, academics, and community organizers.
