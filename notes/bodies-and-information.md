## Medial Bodies

Computers are fiercely abstract machines. This makes it too easy to lose sight of their materiality, their bodies. This body, I believe, extends beyond transistors in silicon and the electrical currents coursing through the wiring of the computer's hardware, despite Friedrich Kittler's strange and wonderful assertion that "There is No Software." The computer's mechanical/electrical physicality is certainly true, but alone it is as reductive a model as the idea that the whole of our own human bodies can be understood simply as the cellular and chemical parts that compose them.

Not all bodies

Cecchetto:

"Sound is differential... sound as such calls us to think of it as a particular object that has no substance, as a kind of ideal object that nonetheless has real material effects... sound resists being placed at all and is in this sense as much relational as it is differential" (2-3)

"For McLuhan, these four 'laws of media' collectively stem from the premise that 'each of man's artefacts is in fact a kind of word, a metaphor that translates experience from one form into another' so that artifacts of both hardware (i.e. a table, or a stick) and software (i.e. an idea, or a preposition) nature are understood by McLuhan as extensions of a human body (which includes that body's mind). However, the simultaneity of each vector--that is, the fact that every enhancement carries with it a simultaneous reversal potential, obsolescence, and retrieval--in combination with the present ubiquity of intelligent machines has ultimately decentered this human body, specifically by suggesting that the body itself, as well as subjectivity, is invested by technology." (6)

This computational body is best seen, perhaps, through works of art. Software, though so often conceived of as representational or simulational in character, has real effects in _this_ world--it influences and can be influenced by our own bodies and perceptual apparatuses. It is true that we may not be able to directly touch a piece of software, but it undoubtedly has effects and a texture of its own. <cecchetto and sound as one example of an unruly bod>, and then the argument via Mitchell and Hansen that all perception--the visual perception of my cinema, for example--ultimately conects with an inner hapticity and sense of touch--by looking at the surface of my videos (and it's not only a surface--the reflection of the projector's beam through the space, illuminating the dust in its path), we are in some sense, via a distinctly technically-co-mingled perception that is entirely human, touching them and the software algorithms within them--these algorithmic energies, too, touch us with their light, duration...

* the body of cinema--light, spatial coextensivity, duration--link this to the relational body of sound in Cecchetto
* Jane Bennet, poetry's body
* computation and cinema both are often understood as predominantly _representational_ in nature, and I believe that computation shares with corporate cinema its too-often fictional character
* Wark: "the virtuality of expression. Representation always mimics but is less than what it represents; expression always differs from but exceeds the raw material of its production" (103).
* Elder: "When a representation conveys information about an object, it does so by classifying it, by making it an instance of one or more kinds of entities recognized by the culture whose resources are drawn upon by the process through which representations are constructed" (308).
3. Propose, based on Jane Bennett ("Texts are bodies that can light up, by rendering human perception more acute, those bodies whose favoured vehicle of affectivity is less wordy: plants, animals, blades of grass, household objects, trash") and Mark Hansen ("all reality is mixed reality", "technics are co-constitutive of our embodied perception"), that computation is itself embodied: software has a body, and enacts real bodily effects/affects in the world


THE KEY TO ALL OF THIS IS NOT SO MUCH THAT THE MATERIAL ASPECTS OF SOFTWARE ARE SOMEHOW THE SUBJECT OF MY VIDEOS, BUT RATHER THAT THE PERCEPTUAL EXPERIENCE, AND THE TECHNICS THAT CO-CONSTITUTE OUR PERCEPTION OF THE REAL, DOUBLES THE MODIFIABILITY OF SOFTWARE--THAT IT IS THESE TWO FORMS OF TRANSFORMATION--TECHNICAL AND PERCEPTUAL--THAT GIVE MY WORK ITS BODY, AND WHICH CREATES A COMMUNITY OUT OF AND WITHIN THESE ARTISTIC ARTIFACTS.














# Notes on Information, Bodies, and Energy

* the key is a different form of materiality, one which is not dominated by the "structuring metaphors" of solidity, permanence, etc. and towards more flexible materials, particularly (like Trigger-Holroyd) those that are amenable to extension, change over time
* artwork as vector: structuring of communities around _an artifact_

## Wark, Hacker Manifesto

Highlighted on Page 44: The hacking of new vectors of information has indeed been the turning point in the emergence of a broader awareness of the creative production of abstraction.

Page 45: "Everywhere the desire to open the virtuality of information, to share data as a gift, to appropriate the vector for expression"

"To the extent that nature exists even in its disappearance, it exists as expression. Nature still exists, not as the other of the social, but as the multiplicity of forces that the human in concert with the nonhuman articulate and express. In differentiating itself from nature, human agency does not alienate itself from nature, it merely brings into being yet one more aspect of nature’s multiplicity" (77).

"Once the vector reaches the point of the development of telesthesia--the perception at a distance of the telegraph, telephone, television--it effects a separation of the flow of communication from the flow of objects and subjects, and thus produces the appearance of information as a world apart" (79).

"Information--in the commodified form of communication--becomes the governing metaphor for the world precisely because it dominates it in actuality" (79)

"Third nature, in its very totality, its spectacle of vectors and vectors of spectacle, becomes an ecology of images which may yet become an image of a possible ecology. Third nature relentlessly enfolds the subject in images of the world as its object. But in its very ubiquity, it dissolves the particular relations of subjects to objects, and represents subjects as a whole with the image of an objective world as a whole. In its very falsity, it represents the relation between subject and object as a false relation, but nevertheless as a relation. Third nature reveals its own nature to be something produced. Third nature reveals itself as something not only produced, but productive. Information appears as expression, not just as representation, as something produced in its difference from the world" (80)

Highlighted on Page 88: What calls for a creative applicationof the hack is the production of new vectors along whichthe event may continue to unfold after its initial explosioninto social space, and avoid capture by representation.

## Karen Barad

"According to Bohr, theoretical concepts (e.g., "position" and "momentum") are not ideational in character but rather are specific physical arrangements" (814).

"Matter does not refer to a fixed substance; rather, matter is substance in its intra-active becoming--not a thing, but a doing, a congealing of agency. Matter is a stabilizing and destabilizing process of iterative intra-activity" (822).

"Bodies are not objects with inherent boundaries and properties; they are material-discursive phenomena. "Human" bodies are not inherently different from "nonhuman" ones. What constitutes the "human" (and the "nonhuman") is not a fixed or pregiven notion, but nor is it a free-floating ideality. What is at issue is not some ill-defined process by which human-based linguistic practices (materially supported in some unspecified way) manage to produce substantive bodies/bodily substances but rather a material dynamics of intra-activity: material apparatuses produce material phenomena through specific causal intra-actions, where "material" is always already material-discursive--that is what it means to matter. Theories that focus exclusively on the materialization of "human" bodies miss the crucial point that the very practices by which the differential boundaries of the "human" and the "nonhuman" are drawn are always already implicated in particular materializations. (823-4)


## Voyce

Highlighted on Page 10: Yet, if the centrality of immaterial labor in advanced economies relies increasingly on complex social networks made avail-able by digital technologies, then it is this same mode of production that threatens to demystify individual creativity and to expand nonproprietary forms of knowledge production. If such networks reveal anything about the laboring activities of scientists, technologists, protest movements, or, indeed, even poets, it is that creativity demands appropriation, collabora-tion, and community.

Highlighted on Page 20: To call a poetic text “commons based” signals its participation within a larger ensemble of discourses, events, and actions undertaken to protect public culture from proprietary enclosure.

Highlighted on Page 21: Next, we should conceive of the commons as a practice—and thus in-ject a logic of the commons into the fabric of our thoughts and actions.

Pages 22-3: This now canonical definition of modernist experimental practice overshadows the intensely social projects of com-munity building undertaken by artistic communities throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It is this social imperative that gives direction to contemporary practice. The role of artistic and literary collectives today need not jettison agonism as such, but rather its sometimes elitist, chauvinistic, fascistic, and eschatological associations. The respon-sibility of the avant-garde will instead require an activistic obligation to create and fortify public domains of open source knowledge, to challenge excessive restrictions placed on language and information, to bring forth marginalized knowledges from a position of inaccessibility to the public at large, and to produce and share artistic tactics and works that challenge intellectual property. That which is at stake is nothing less than open acces-sibility to culture. Hence, writers and artists are becoming more collaborative and interdisciplinary, drawing on the general and specialized skills of archivists, programmers, academics, and community organizers.

## Boneyard from Vibrant Bodies section

Where Welsby's piece is "performed" by the wind and time's passing, _Font Màgica_ looks inward, performing Chopin with Chopin in order to produce something else.

--


"If we consider art as a material-driven process of production, these anonymous materials enjoy an autonomy of their own; and such autonomy continuously interferes with the artwork itself regardless of the decisions of the artist--that is, whether or not the artist determines to be 'open' to their influence... contingent materials cannot be directly embraced" (Negarestani 1).

* so the key to bridging this section and the previous one is that the "material commons" is alive, other artists' material becomes a force that perturbs the new artwork's system.
* material also withdraws
* Algorithmic system as "a mode of coherency or a cunning closure capable of bringing these contingent plays into focus" (4)
* All this leads into a little meditation on algorithms and systems and creativity
    * algorithms, at least tropicly, suggest a rhetoric of control, and one that is particularly perspectival--from above, an "architectural" viewpoint from above (which we know from De Certeau is an abstract view of space), a view of the system as a whole
    * but in part I compose with algorithms in order to have my view of the system partially obscured, to release energies that come not from a kind of abstract adherence to rules or, equally, openness to chance, but through a kind of obsessive material myopia that allows a system to start feeding on itself, to see more individual trees rather than whole forests
* to try to resolve these two sections--the artifactual material and the citational material, perhaps Munster's idea of transmateriality as being a kind of signaletic mediation of materials and the potential for energy to form into a material, is useful
    - her description of Simondon's idea of transduction "...is processual... it involves knitting, knotting, interlacing together or mediating across diverse elements... a process of becoming something" (11)
* Signal is the key here to mediating these two kinds of materialities: "media arts has its ontogenesis in the discovery of the transmateriality of signal and in experiments with tranducing signals' intensities into novel compositions" (12)

"Complicity is an extreme form of speculation, one that grasps the work from the perspective of its contingent materials... complicity gives the artist the speculative opportunity to see the work as the reflection of the contingent materials on themselves, their secret collusions, antagonisms, indifferent attitudes, and their weird twists in and out of the possibilities they bring about... the artist must recognize herself as the conspiracy theorist of her materials" (3).

What my software artworks afford as vectors for new artworks, I can't predict at present. <necessity>

* note how this approach to signal processing isn't limited to audible sound, and has become a crucial technique in my approach to video processing, to the point where _Aconite_ explicitly supports the injection and synchronization of Flocking synths into its frame-processing pipeline.

Following this, I will extend the concept of materiality into the created artifact itself, exploring (via the analogy of knitting) how software art can can be vectorized, potentially serving simultaneously as a "primary work" and as the medium for other, integrally linked works of art.

In contrast to Voyce's (and Stallman's, for that matter) textual, appropriative, "forking"<sup>7</sup> mode of modifiability, I am arguing for an artifactual one. Voyce: "While modifying a source text might involve deleting or excising, it can also involve extending, transforming, and sharing a given work... Such techniques release a portion of a text from its static, fixed position in a single work, enabling it to participate in a proliferation of potential texts amid continuously changing assemblages of authorial, intertextual, and communal networks" (409).



"The responsibility of the avant-garde will instead require an activistic obligation to create and fortify public domains of open source knowledge, to challenge excessive restrictions placed on language and information, to bring forth marginalized knowledges from a position of inaccessibility to the public at large, and to produce and share artistic tactics and works that challenge intellectual property. That which is at stake is nothing less than open accessibility to culture" (427-8).

The original material is often stretched out in time or captured in a single gesture--. It is a process of taking a piu

* a process of de-registering and offsetting and making multiples, some stretched out in time or in a gesture, others just gently warped by an algorithm--and then re-registering the multiplicity of raindrop versions onto each other
* and each version is somehow produced by a reading of the piece itself, through a different lens
*--a little slower or faster, here, worrying over a region of expressive detail, there skipping...

* but then the piece is open differently; each layer, each point of refraction is available to be separated out, reused, or modified in some way. Each node and edge in the assemblage has a name and a handle by which it can be manipulated and extended, "warbledRightPiano" and "distortedLeftPiano," every volume curve or synth that represents the macro structure equally with every grain of the stuttering piano is available to "touch"
* the point of font magica isn't that I composed or programmed with extra-musical concerns in mind, but that it was supported by a _material substrate_ (flocking and infusion) and a set of open community methods that support its extension--that support its use as both "source" and "secondary" (and tertiary, and so on), as well as supporting its linkage between static and executable forms, its "potential" and "actual" forms
* connection with Chris Welsby's _Colour Separation_
 * Even more weirdly, I’m linking it to Welsby’s film Colour Separation, which is completely different but there’s a kind of formal connection--these “mis-registered” layers of sound produced by adherence to a process or algorithm

I am interested in the way that software artifacts can be made to support "material linkages" between existing and new works in a manner that goes in some way beyond citation or appropriation. Voyce insightfully imagines that avant-garde poetics can protect and contribute to a "commons"

### The Work as Vector

The only characteristic that software today shares with knitting, I fear, is its ability to end up as a hopeless tangle on the floor. After the point of compilation into an executable, most software can no longer be serendipitously added to, subtracted from, grafted onto, or unravelled in a form not already planned and designed into it by its creators. And yet, unlike more distinctly solid artifacts such as wood or yarn or metal, software These characteristics, I argue, form the basis for software's largely unre

In the Latourian sense, a compiler fails to preserve modifiability as an "immutable mobile" within the system, and so < what does this mean, take it somewhere >... Notably, with the exception of specialized "automatic programming" (Chun's term) tools such as compilers, generators, interpreters, code's iterability--at least as it is commonly structured today within programming languages like C or Java or SuperCollider--is paradoxically inaccessible (or at least prohibitively complex) to other systems and programs. Software can't understand code, either.


* Ask the question, why do open source, especially when many of the artifacts are personal?--it's unlikely that people will want to fork or remix or reuse this thesis
* Stephen Voyce suggests the potential of an open source poetics: "While modifying a source text might involve deleting or excising, it can also involve extending, transforming, and sharing a given work... Such techniques release a portion of a text from its static, fixed position in a single work, enabling it to participate in a proliferation of potential texts amid continuously changing assemblages of authorial, intertextual, and communal networks."
* And yet he largely links transformation to appropriative tactics or those that "break down conventions of authorship" [my quote] (which are great, but not always what I do) rather to what we call "artifactual linkage" where a work is a Warkian vector-- A vector is more or less a "technological medium"--in principle, anyway, with our approach a given application or, here, artwork, has the potential to serve in some way as the medium for some second-order creativity: an artwork that becomes the medium for other artworks, not as quotation but as "transformation"
* One of the key reasons for producing my artworks (as opposed to just tools that are directly intended to be used and reused) using open source collaborative methods is to turn them into _vectors_--more than just artworks but the basis for new abstractions and potentialities (this of course requires a very different approach not aesthetically, as one might imagine, but technically--to the tools that support software creativity)


an approach to creating and distributing software and texts--including this document--in which artifacts are generated and refined in a transparent and community-oriented fashion and licensed in a manner that encourages reuse, modification, and extension.


* this idea of software as vector, as material, starts to eat away at the form/content dichotomy, since a piece of software, as art (content), is also a medium (form) for engendering new works.

Neither the term "open source" nor "free software" fits my project, though there are aspects of each that am I interested in.

The injection of "community" into my terminology emphasizes not just specific communities of design/development practice, but the argument that creative expression should be possible within context of the aforementioned "vectors of collective becoming," meaning that the act of _working_ a software material should offer the possibility of cohesion, not only of separation (which always remains a choice). Today's software rarely functions in this way, and software's "freedom" is always expressed in terms of its source code, never its "living form" at runtime; freedom here takes the form of a "right" that only an elite access.


The value of working transparently and in a feedback loop with  linking it as much to other like-minded creators around the world as to, equally, exposing it to different approaches that cut
* working transparently and openly is strange
* my work takes on different qualities by being openly available--serving as example for other other artists, and subtly influencing the kinds of works that are made by others
*

The expression of such a material creative influence, however, can undoubtedly not retain its singularity--the myth of _the_ source as a singular "text"...

Chun: ". If we consider source code as a fetish, the fact that source code has hardly deprived programmers of their priestlike/wizard status makes complete sense. If anything, such a notion of programmers has been disseminated ever more and the history of computing--from direct manipulation to hypertext--has been littered by various 'liberations.'"
* in response to Chun's apparently weariness (and wariness) about liberational projects in computing, I argue that we nonetheless need to pursue new and different approaches to computational liberation, since the litter she refers to is in fact cast atop an even more substantial landscape of consumption and control

Substantive changes made to software source code must always be negotiated through an essentially _centralized_ conception of community--all participants must agree to a kind of material "rule of law," or a "fork" will occur, splitting the common artifactual linkage between changes. (NEED A FOOTNOTE ABOUT OPEN SOURCE FORKING).

4. See (Stallman) for an overview of the libertarian politics of the free software movement, whose freedoms are always predicated upon the possession of the specialist skill of being able to write, review, modify, or verify software's _source code_. In contrast, I am interested in challenging (via practical efforts) the basic Cartesian dualism of computation: the distinction between "code" and its execution, where the nexus of change and influence is currently centralized in the source code, rather than the running artifact of software. I will pick this theme up again later in the section on _Software Bodies_.
