# Notes on Information, Bodies, and Energy

## Wark, Hacker Manifesto

"To the extent that nature exists even in its disappearance, it exists as expression. Nature still exists, not as the other of the social, but as the multiplicity of forces that the human in concert with the nonhuman articulate and express. In differentiating itself from nature, human agency does not alienate itself from nature, it merely brings into being yet one more aspect of natureâ€™s multiplicity" (77).

"Once the vector reaches the point of the development of telesthesia--the perception at a distance of the telegraph, telephone, television--it effects a separation of the flow of communication from the flow of objects and subjects, and thus produces the appearance of information as a world apart" (79).

"Information--in the commodified form of communication--becomes the governing metaphor for the world precisely because it dominates it in actuality" (79)

"Third nature, in its very totality, its spectacle of vectors and vectors of spectacle, becomes an ecology of images which may yet become an image of a possible ecology. Third nature relentlessly enfolds the subject in images of the world as its object. But in its very ubiquity, it dissolves the particular relations of subjects to objects, and represents subjects as a whole with the image of an objective world as a whole. In its very falsity, it represents the relation between subject and object as a false relation, but nevertheless as a relation. Third nature reveals its own nature to be something produced. Third nature reveals itself as something not only produced, but productive. Information appears as expression, not just as representation, as something produced in its difference from the world" (80)
