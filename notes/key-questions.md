# Research Questions and Artistic Concerns

## Bodies

* What role does embodiment play in (my) digital media and software?
* What is a body? Do videos and software programs have bodies?
* What kinds of couplings occur between human and digital bodies, and what kinds of effects, modulations, and transformations can occur within and amongst these assemblages?

## Time

* Why are my videos presented as _cinema_, rather than as gallery installations? What qualities of cinema are in motion in my work? How does this relate to other media, and to my compositional practice?
* How does duration operate in my work, and what intensive (on bodies in the time of the work) and extensive (carried on after the time of the screening) effects and affects are generated and attenuated in and amongst bodies by this taking time?

## Software and Community

* How can we understand software not only through the familiar discourse of its informatics and immateriality&em;of representation and simulation&em;but also as an energetic system with its own bodies, which has real (i.e. material) effects?
* What role does software play in my own creative practice, both in terms of frictions and enablements? What other modes for software creativity are available to us, aside from the prevailing rhetoric of power, control, and possibility?
* What techniques (both philosophical and creatively-applied) can we imagine to help us shift creative power from designers/developers to individuals and their communities? How can creativity be _linked_, helping to sustain and modulate creative practice in new ways?
