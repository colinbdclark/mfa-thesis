# Notes on Duration

## Gentle critique of Elditch

* I can't shake the sense that by structuring his discussion in negative terms (i.e. on "boredom"), some kind of strange transformation occurs
* There is a gap--the gap between the strange and wonderful contingencies and energies of sound and the "depression" of critical theory discourse--that separates us from the experience of _listening_ (both to and away); if boredom is indeed a factor in many of the long-duration works Eldritch discusses--despite the arguments of their creators against an aesthetics of boredom--it emerges not in the expansion/contraction of listening, but in the distance of criticality and discourse--talking about music, rather than being in and alongside it as _listeners_.
