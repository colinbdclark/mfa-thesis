# Outline

1. Abstract & Acknowledgements
2. Introduction
    * Description of my work (video, sound, design) and the goal of this theoretical component of it
        * brief overview of my videos and of Flocking & Aconite
    * Nature of my practice, connections/refactractions/transformations of my technical and aesthetic practice
    * Description of how several key concepts (lensing and modulation) play a three-part role in my work:
        1. technical/literal (e.g. the actual camera lens, signals in Flocking, image processing in Aconite)
        2. perceptual/aesthetic
        3. methodological/theoretical
3. Methods
    * Critique of interdisciplinarity, practice-based research
        * Desire to avoid "disciplinary tourism," synthesis of disciplines
        * An attempt to accept my practices as "somewhat separate"
        * Recognize that, without unifying the disciplines fully (risking homogenization) that practicing in multiple disciplines has _effects_ (refractions, transformations, emergence of new creative events) on each other
    * Proposal of _disciplinary adjacency_ via second-order systems theory
        * a set of localized, project-specific tactics to generate "microdisciplines/micromethods" for a practice _amongst and in between_ disciplines
    * Key methods:
        * Lensing
        * Open source collaboration
4. Lensing
    * "Lensing is a mode of practice and theory that emphasizes transformational interactions amongst artworks, bodies, and concepts."
    * Technical, perceptual, conceptual
    * Relationship to Bal's _framing_
    * Brakhage, his vision exercises, _The Cat of the Worm's Green realm_, energy
    * My own perceptual exercises and technical and bodily lensing
    * _Everything is Awake!_, _Indian Horse_
5. Information, Energy, Duration, and Modulation
    * How synthesis modulation works (Flocking)
    * Latour, "there is no information"
    * _In Passing_ as transformation
    * Environmental systems and modulation: Welsby's _Anemometer_ and _Greenwich Park_
    * Duration
        * Lazzarato/Bergson
        * Priest, "boring"
        * Case studies:
            * _Drift and Cut_: recreational, pointless, drifting time
            * Long takes in _Tiny Trumpets_, etc.
            * Temporal folding and folding, coextensive time in _Tofino_
6. Vibrant Bodies
    * Sonic and Cinema Bodies
        * Extended materialism, Bennett
        * Cinematic bodies and Ernie Gehr's _Side/Walk/Shuttle_
        * Durational bodies: _Tofino_, _Freezing_, _Drift and Cut_
    * Software Materiality
        * Open source software
        * Open as Method
        * The Transformational/Material Commons
            * Voyce, open source poetics
            * My artworks as potential vectors
            * Flocking, Aconite, _Font MÃ gica_
    * Software Bodies
        * Kittler, Chun, and a critique of limiting computation's materiality to hardware
        * Hanson, "all reality is mixed reality," technics as constituitive of embodied perception
        * _Body_ defined as that which has material influences on other bodies
        * Jane Bennett, vibrant matter, poetry as body, etc.
7. Conclusion: Insignificant Surfaces
    * Flusser and the everyday, Mekas
    * Next steps in my project
