# Outline

1. Abstract
2. Introduction
  * Description of my work (video, sound, design) and the goal of this theoretical component of it
    * brief overview of my videos and of Flocking & Aconite
  * Nature of my practice, connections/refactractions/transformations of my technical and aesthetic practice
  * Description of how several key concepts (lensing and modulation) play a three-part role in my work:
    1. technical/literal (e.g. the actual camera lens, signals in Flocking, image processing in Aconite)
    2. perceptual/aesthetic
    3. methodological/theoretical
3. Methods
  * Critique of interdisciplinarity, practice-based research
    * Desire to avoid "disciplinary tourism," synthesis of disciplines
    * An attempt to accept my practices as "somewhat separate"
    * Recognize that, without unifying the disciplines fully (risking homogenization) that practicing in multiple disciplines has _effects_ (refractions, transformations, emergence of new creative events) on each other
  * Proposal of _disciplinary adjacency_ via second-order systems theory
      * a set of localized, project-specific tactics to generate "microdisciplines/micromethods" for a practice _amongst and in between_ disciplines
  * Key methods:
    * Lensing
      * Relationship to Bal's _framing_
    * Open source collaboration
    * Reflexive, iterative studio/design practice
4. Lensing
  * Lensing as a combined technical, perceptual, and methodological activity throughout my work
    * Computation: Infusion and Ben Pierce's lensing
    * Aesthetic/perceptual: Brakhage case study below
    * Methodological: relationship to disciplinary adjacency, understanding disciplinary practice as a form of _mutation_ or transformation (bending, skewing, defocusing, refocusing) via the method of lensing
  * Brakhage's _The Cat of the Worm's Green Realm_, his perceptual exercises
  * Second-order systems theory
    * Lensing as "perturbation and irritation" of distinct, withdrawn systems
  * Mark Hansen and "all reality is mixed reality"
    * Technics as key constitutient of our experience of "reality"
    * Opens up an expanded field of phenomenological activity, including the phenomenology of computation and digital media here
5. Bodies
  * Jane Bennett, _vibrant matter_, expanded concept of bodies
  * Cinematic bodies (projection, light, space)
    * Case study: Ernie Gehr's _Side/Walk/Shuttle_ (the transformation of our own proprioception/embodied experience of gravity)
    * Case study: My "everday" vibrational videos as vibrant matter: relationship between my body, camera's (lens's) body, cinematic body, and viewer's body: _By the Fire_, _Everything is Awake!_, _Indian Horse_, _How Long Will We Live?_
  * Computational bodies: _software has a body_
6. Flocking and Aconite
  * What they are, why they exist, the nature of their bodies
    * Material computing
    * Declarative programming
  * The community dimension of my project
    * Linked artworks
    * New access to computational creativity, breaking the code fetish, code/graphical dichotomy
  * Looking forward, a lifetime creative/technicalcommitment
    * Case study: Alan Kay's Dynabook and cardboard mockups
7. Signals: information, Transformation and Energetics
    * Modulation as technical system (in Flocking)
    * Latour and critique of informatics
    * Case study of _In Passing_
    * Environmental systems
        * Chris Welsby's _Anemometer_ and my _Greenwich Park_
8. Bodies in time: modulation and duration
    * Lazzarato/Bergson
    * Priest, "boring"
    * Case studies:
      * _Drift and Cut_: recreational, pointless, drifting time
      * Long takes in _Tiny Trumpets_, etc.
      * Temporal folding and folding, coextensive time in _Tofino_
9. Conclusion
